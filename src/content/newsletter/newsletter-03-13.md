Good morning (if it's actually morning for you) and happy Monday from New England!

It was actually a quieter and joyful week for everybody and it's definitely something that feels a lot better than before. I was so worried this last week that it felt oddly weird that I didn't have to write so much tonight and that that this newsletter is like, less than half the length of the last one...

Ready for the news?

This week's featured picture is Margaritaville on CivMC. Although it's recently become part of Lambat, the tropical vacation resort has transformed rapidly into the Civ equivalent of Santa Monica Pier, from a brand new Ferris Wheel to a whipping roller coaster all on a little island in the sea. Still a great place for a nice getaway, now with both thrills and chills! Give a hand to MaybeGravy for his great work to make this a paradise for everyone!

### Featured Article

*This week's featured article was NOT written by Yodabird.*

The **[AF-CES Partnership](https://civwiki.org/wiki/AF-CES_Partnership)** was a supra-alliance organization between the alliances of the [Augustan Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Augustan_Federation) and the [Conference of Eastern States](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CES) on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic). The partnership was created due to amicable diplomatic relations, especially with countries like [Lambat](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Lambat_(CivClassic_2.0)) being part of both alliances, and continued military exercises and cultural exchange. In late August, both alliances agreed to formally cooperate with each other in diplomatic and military affairs.

Despite the partnership's short-lived lifespan, the alliances heavily cooperated in international affairs. Both alliances were involved in several crises, such as the [Mount September Ice Road Conflict](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_September_Ice_Road_Conflict), issues with [Kallos](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Kallos) with [minemaster933](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Minemaster933)'s pearl, and the [Battle of Eddie Murphy](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Battle_of_Eddie_Murphy). Due to the general dissatisfaction from the partnership, several nations, such as Lambat, [Gabon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gabon) and [Lusitania](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Lusitania_(CivClassic_2.0)) leaving from the CES or AF. Although both parties hoped to continue the partnership, the end of CivClassic eventually saw the end of the cooperative. An international alliance cooperative like the partnership never emerged on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC), where many of the countries' successors are playing. **[Full article...](https://civwiki.org/wiki/AF-CES_Partnership)**

*Gensokyo's first "hut" on CivReign (Topaz will get mad at me for saying it's a hut)*

- [Raids by Okx and Doom_Weaver continued](https://sites.google.com/view/thelaurentiandispatch/volume-one-issue-three?authuser=0) on several CivReign nations. *Crossposted from the Laurentian Dispatch.*
  - However, Okx [was banned this week following accusations](https://sites.google.com/view/thelaurentiandispatch/volume-one-issue-four) from the admins on x-raying.
  - Doom_Weaver argued that [TTastic did not have any substantial evidence for banning Doom_Weaver](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1083538108584300584) and continued to call for his unbanning after clean gameplay.
  - The mistake [was eventually rectified the next day](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1083865223800307812) and they continued to raid with less success than before -- [although they continued to raid Laurentia](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1083541642100883507) and broke chests in an attempt to despawn materials, [Laurentians eventually killed Okx and fredhun/Doom_Weaver](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1084108410557038663).
  - It didn't really slow them down though, [as they continued raiding with little to no resistance](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1084216970980884530) with [some being frustrated with the raider playstyle being heavily favored with the slow tech tree.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1084217031236264078)
- Agent_Sparks9 [was accused of unruly behavior in Vangar](https://sites.google.com/view/thelaurentiandispatch/volume-one-issue-three?authuser=0) and was evicted from the country this past week. *Crossposted from the Laurentian Dispatch.*
  - Sparks claimed it was a disagreement from a carpentry factory and their communist ideology. He also desired to make his own country but ran into claim conflicts with other towns in Vangar.
  - The unsavory behavior reached a climax with Sparks' house being raided by Umbrian officials followed by Vangar's capital, Slumville being raided.
  - While the situation is resolved now with Sparks having his own nation, it left unsatisfied parties in both nations.
- Elections among most major nations started up once again:
  - [Zhirall, Aeth, and Lunaacatt was elected as the first judges in Laurentia](https://discord.com/channels/1073671116968697927/1075791810686894131/1083803083991171213)
  - [CuntJesus was elected as Prime Minister of Norlund](https://discord.com/channels/961315851552845824/961336276383039488/1082826439386202153) followed by JPM, Joadgr and Bernie Sanders (haha) filling out his cabinet
- In the wake of the Okx raids, [Laurentia also opened their doors to international factory access and market trade](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11ke87u/government_of_laurentia_announcement_of/), regularly selling bronze and later [steel pickaxes](https://discord.com/channels/1073671116968697927/1075791810686894131/1082495244953731204).
- A [relatively easy to obtain Miner Brew was released to the public](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11mjupj/miners_brew_discovered_and_perfected/) by Hikoru promising night vision and better luck while mining.
- That is, if the luck feature worked on discovery as an admin mistake [actually prevented any ores while mining.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1083302483050364989) [This was fixed later on Saturday.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1084122465845903410)
- Other updates on the server included the long-awaited inclusion of brewery, with [57 brews of various types](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1082482006958547034), [continued HiddenOre and mining fixes](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1083233506601213983), and [general preprations for Adamantine rebalancing.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1084122465845903410)
- The continued updates to reduce grindiness and the beginning of actual progression have [made the perception of the server generally better than the previous couple of weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11o72tw/how_do_you_feel_about_the_current_state_of/), and the playerbase believe admins are moving in the right direction to make change.
- In the meanwhile, [admin Cortwade is hosting a server-wide Gartic Phone game on March 17](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1084673493205008386).

*The Shiroyama Ice Rink minutes before the start of the Olympics opening ceremonies.*

### Sports Reporting

Of course, the talk of the server this week was the Naran Olympics. A big hand to Blatlas, Bron, Prawny, Swordmaster and everyone on the organizing team who did a great job putting all of this together.

Please insert Joe Buck commentating riveting chess gameplay here.

- Preliminary hockey matches continued throughout the week, with
  - [Nara blowing out Mercutio in their first match, 15-0](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ksayn/nara_v_mercutie_olympic_ice_hockey_match_150/)
  - [Mercutio winning a close match against Pavia, 2-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11mgvhm/mercutio_v_pavia_21_drinking_the_most_viewed/)
  - [CDM winning 2v2 against a tough Yoahtl team, 7-5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11o2o8t/cdm_v_yoahtl_75/)
- As well as chess matches:
  - The newcomer [Thrall Clan won their first chess match this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11nylj2/the_great_thrall_clan_wins_their_first_olympic/)
  - [Pavia's spleef match was followed by a round of chess with grepsedawk](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11mgvhm/mercutio_v_pavia_21_drinking_the_most_viewed/)
- [The opening ceremony had several issues of fireworks and speeches from  Swordmaster and Lowtuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11o8cqy/olympics_opening_ceremony_shiroyama_nara/)
- [Several events were won by MechanicalRift](https://discord.com/channels/762743753076375583/1083905399289303041/1084193731273560125), including Summitting and Shooting
- The 1v1s had some ridiculous near-ties, with [Cortesian Yodabird and Commoner reffelruz tying](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1083905399289303041/1084236167219777586/image.png) alongside [S4NTA and Hg__80 also near-tying in the final with S4NTA just eking out the win](https://discord.com/channels/762743753076375583/1083905399289303041/1084243875922718750)
- Additionally people forgot they had pearls in their inventory, [which made some people pearled](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1084239701139017858) and others completely randomspawned, like VilyanZ which delayed the entire Olympics by an hour as he had to travel all the way from Yodel to get back to competing...
- The hockey tournament was the marquee event on Saturday night, although Icarus [lost 4-7 against home-team-advantage team Nara](https://discord.com/channels/762743753076375583/1083905399289303041/1084271192782942278).
- Unfortunately despite all these events, [much of the preliminary events were not executed in time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11p3552/olympic_saturday/jbvupue/) meaning that several big coordinated tournaments like hockey, spleef and chess are set to have delays and medals awarded long past the Olympic end date.
- As of [the conclusion of the Olympics](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11pytzt/olympics_closing_ceremony/) on Sunday, [Nara went all out for this Olympics with 17 medals total with 5 golds](https://discord.com/channels/762743753076375583/762743753512714240/1084666349319626754), with Estalia coming in second in the medal count with 7, probably won from all the PvP events.

Screenshots and videos of events are being uploaded in the coming days.

Now the question is, [are we going to have to wait another three months for another Olympics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11pyvvs/until_next_time/)

### Actual News

Of course, there is actual drama but there's little to speak of this week:

- So just to rephrase [on the Danzilona coup as discussed last week](/newsletter-03-06#eastern-affairs):
  - SandFalls as part of the Worker's Party, counter-couped the Junta government led by Des23 on March 5.
  - Azelair [restored the government of the Free Worker's Commune of Danzilona on March 6](https://discord.com/channels/952401079339995166/952591282386124820/1082379878197899335) and declared that New Swisston would not be excluded, stating that "Many people were involved in bringing this iteration to life and ultimately it is up to all of us to keep this thing together."
  - March 7 [then saw Lowtuff take complete ownership of the country](https://discord.com/channels/952401079339995166/952591282386124820/1082762299078619266), after adopting a Carson-like model refounded by Lowtuff, they are claiming that "Danzilona has become part of Lowtuff", in a way. Profound.
  - This was only reiterated during his Olympics opening ceremonies speech that "Danzilona is me", but [I don't have a source but trust me bro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7l0Rq9E8MY)
- [Accusations of Leibniz Confederation's inactivity were rife last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11n7uxv/the_leibnez_confederation_is_extremely_active/), as Okx has been more active on CivReign raiding.
  - [Warmia unclaimed a small area last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ecr8g/the_federation_of_warmia_unclaims_the_territory/jaeqcq5/), and the area has been under interest by several parties due to its large holdings of land (read: tiny islands) in the Southeast. At the time, [Leibniz's leaders claimed they were trying to find the best way to promote activity in the Southwest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ecr8g/the_federation_of_warmia_unclaims_the_territory/jaeqcq5/)
  - Warmia unilaterally unclaimed [Leibniz's land due to their inactivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11jt4iu/as_a_governor_of_the_federation_of_warmia_i_want/), and implored Leibniz to unclaim more land
  - Eventually [Leibniz sold an island](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ow9mq/leibniz_confederation_has_sold_this_island_to/) to nearby [Venne for one diamond](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/687531186117148706/1083575104308531230/Woo.png), and Venne [was able to finally announce that they had built on the island for months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11p3g72/announcing_venozia_vennes_new_capital/)
- After Shadno potted up accidentally at the Olympics [everyone went absolutely insane until they realize literally everyone overreacted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11mgnrt/icenian_aggression_at_the_olympics_like_this_is/)
- Neubergburg was also claimed over by the [Great Thrall Clan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11lf3c0/great_clan_expedition_neubergburg_land_ceding/) following inactivity.
- This week also marked the creation of several states on the server, with [Weirdscraftland joining from little-known ScratchCiv](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11n8kx3/weirdscraftland_joins_civmc/), and newcomers [YSFR](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11jznxx/claims_of_the_new_nation_in_the_west_respein/) and [Roal-Devoir in the East](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ntczd/i_remade_my_land_so_nation_are_called_roaldevouir/), alongside [Athimwaabi](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ktd9y/athimwaabis_sultan_has_befallen_an_unfortunate/) and [Respein in the West](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11jznxx/claims_of_the_new_nation_in_the_west_respein/)
- Pacem introduced their railroad company, [planning to build railroads across the server.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11ofzoy/introducingthe_pacem_railroad_company/)
- While CivMC did not make an official announcement, they hired new moderators ArkenX, Cissonius, Greenish9, and JuniorTide to help with discord and reddit moderation.
- [Mount Augusta elected an extremely hotly contested judge race with one single candidate, Logic_Man who definitely did not lose](https://discord.com/channels/948288144384589865/966802236829216798/1083423722771329174)
- Unfortunately a few hours past the deadline, but [Nara also launched 8 lanterns last week in commemoration of International Women's Day for survivors of domestic violence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11jpx6u/tonight_in_shiroyama_we_launched_8_lanterns_in/)

## Everything Else

- [AnimeReviewer created a retrospective on his own history](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11m22fb/civmc_anime_review/) and Civ and his journey to becoming a leader in Estalia.
- **A blast from the past:** [Take a look at Lodish's transcription of Seldomshock's speech from the opening of the Orion Olympics on Civcraft 2.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/civwiki/comments/11nrmc2/orion_olympics_opening_speech_by_seldomshock/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- [With CivReign losing a global map website](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11mc1n1/is_there_any_group_working_on_a_world_map/), it really emphasizes how much [Gjum's contributions to niche Civ things](https://github.com/Gjum/CivMap) are incredibly helpful for the whole community.
- [DockerImage attempted to host a small PvP tournament on Bunkies this past week](https://discord.com/channels/1059676468701057044/1059680482473807973/1083190883622600775) but ultimately failed due to very few people actually showing up...

Although CivReign player counts have been staying pace with CivMC for the past few weeks, it dipped down to around 10 last weekend. [CivReign players have wanted the admins to advertise](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1084595995150651542), however admins have previously stated that they would not do so unless they had a product ready to show, which has also started a debate about newfriendliness. Others have started developing Civ servers as you've seen in this fixture, but it really takes time to develop servers for no money.

## The Fun Stuff

![](https://i.redd.it/otdvwxwo3uma1.png)

*Fempire's "big lady doing Yoga" as self-described by Brudrustro, but it's made out of copper, so I guess it's closer to a Statue of Liberty? Maybe?*

### Builds

- [Not particularly too impressive but the effort behind SPQR's great hall is worth commending](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/963450138192404491/1082539719642066985/image.png), maybe it's just the picture angle
- Edius is actually coming along faster than I thought, with [a render along the sea being a great sight](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1080832057405620334/1082867495444172870/area_render_6.png) as well as [a proper screenshot along a cliffside house](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11lva3z/edius_proper_as_of_march_8_2023/)

They really have a wide collection of pictures and builds with spectacular views.
- [Incredible Olympics photography from Torynado](https://discord.com/channels/762743753076375583/1084324292516380744/1084662142059429918), I need to know what his shaders are

*Seldomshock's newest builds in Shockton next to the beach. Lusitania 2, anyone?*

Thank you for reading [week number 44 of the newsletter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm8k5h12VnI) -- I think there's too many weeks and I accidentally removed one from the collections playlist on Reddit now...

Special unthanks to Yodabird who didn't write his featured article on time after giving him a 2-week delay, but also thanks to Yodabird for making good content that I used for the featured article picture, so I guess it cancels out??

- If you want to write your own featured article, contact me or [feel free to fill out this form](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)! I *will* cold call you if you don't, there's always some interesting story that you don't know is interesting...
- If you just want to rant, feel free to write an op-ed or any opinion article, even just a retrospective on the past [like AnimeReviewer's this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11m22fb/civmc_anime_review/). Honestly, anything.
- If you'd rather just throw money at me, [donate to my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/specificlanguage). **Thanks to Lodish for making a "wise decision" by donating to me** and all he got back was this shoutout.

As we're coming up to the 1-year mark of the newsletter, I'm thinking about starting a Civ images competition [akin to Pavia's](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/971089862931386409/1076971290893766676). Keep an eye on that.

Back to the weekly grind it is then! Until next time...
