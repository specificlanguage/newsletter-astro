Good Monday Morning from New England. Hopefully everyone is having a great launch, whichever server you're playing. And if you're not playing CivMC, hope you're having fun playing nevertheless.

Something new this week: since now there's so much news, only the ones noted with a plus sign **<sup>(+)</sup>** are noted to be the current events present on the front page of the Wiki. All other current events are just noted here for their notoreity or otherwise.

## Current Events

![**This week's featured picture is the claims map posted by u/theJqmn.**](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/6/61/CivMCClaims.png)

### Prelaunch Hype

* **CivMC was released last Thursday, June 2.** Prior to launch that day, Wingzero [released notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v3e5pe/launch_in_6_hours_feature_summary/) on the new features that would be arriving on launch.<sup>(+)</sup>
* u/Gjum released the 2.0 version of the [Map Sync mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v310bq/mapsync_share_map_data_with_your_friends_live/) allowing you to sync up map data with your friends live on the server.
* u/Dilluexe [released **an amazing new trailer** for CivMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v3knl0/civmc_teaser_trailer/).<sup>(+)</sup>
*  Prior to launch, many different polls were posted like "[what was your best Civ experience?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v203bh/what_was_your_best_civ_experience/)", "[what is the best political system?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v2wuwh/which_political_system_makes_the_best_nations/)", "[who will start the first war?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v1wf03/when_do_you_think_the_first_war_will_happen/)", "[who will get Prot IV first?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v1we4l/when_do_you_think_the_first_prot_set_will_be_made/)", "[when will I ever get a girlfriend?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vkF-k56b2g)"

### "Houston, We're a Go for Launch"<sup>(+)</sup>
* The launch saw [**nearly 450** players attempting to join,](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/9/96/Civmcfirstday.png) making it one of the largest Civ server launches on record. That number stayed for the weekend, with peak hours reaching above 300 on the server.
* The first day saw one of the smoothest Civ server launches with the server running near-perfectly despite the player load, causing scarce interruption over launch weekend.
* [Continuous technical support](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/952312337065451530/983041842310447154) was made throughout the weekend to increase the number of players on the server and fix a few errant bugs in production.

### Grayon Glaims

* Something nearly unprecedented on CivMC's launch was that nearly every nation [posted their land claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/h01ab5/civ_political_map_starter_pack/) within launch weekend; usually announcing land claims this early was [just an invitation to get raided.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4ebjv/the_official_claim_of_the_confederal_aztec_empire/) <sup>(+)</sup>
* There were so many claims that **u/TheJqmn created [the first (generally) comprehensive claims map of the server.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v5noos/civmc_unofficial_and_a_few_other_areas_claims_map/)** <sup>(+)</sup>
* Among the fun map highlights are:
  * [TKON](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4uzcf/tkon_map_claim/) faced disputes from Pacem, Petrichor, Icenia, and Rivenfall
  * [Arsenio Pact's claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v47rqq/current_em_claims/) faced quite a difficult situation with both [Nara](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4hdx3/please_stop_overclaiming_our_territories_ap_joint/) and [Mount Doom](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4kg0h/the_arsenio_pact_june_4th_claims/) claiming near their borders, the latter nearly reaching a boiling point until both were resolved relatively peacefully.
  * Some countries had to resettle their borders due to the changing landscape including [Lambat](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4lrvs/the_east_rises_again_lambats_official_claims/) and [Cordoba](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4xej5/republic_of_cordobas_claim_2/).
* Other funny claims include:
  * MrJoCrafter's new [People's Republic of the Western Boundary](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v3q1w7/announcing_the_peoples_republic_of_western/) was superceded by a new [nation of poop](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v3r1px/announcing_the_poop/).
  * The Chronicles of [STUPID Island:](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4dzc2/i_am_claiming_this_stupid_island_that_is_so_bad/) [it got flooded](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4undo/decided_to_start_flooding_stupid_island_because/)
  * By complete coincidence, Nara and Gensokyo, two Japanese nations, [claimed literally right next to each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v5op3k/is_looking_great_everyone/)
  * Camiseo claimed [dick and balls islands](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v5leo2/republic_of_camiseo_island_claim/)


### The Meme Queue

One large complaint on launch was the server's queue; the high demand during the launch weekend and peak hours saw [long queues reaching over 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4gpr9/civball_the_queue_experience/), the admins [have confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v3e5pe/launch_in_6_hours_feature_summary/) they are working on upgrading the server and introducing [sharding](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Shards) to increase the overall server population.<sup>(+)</sup>

As a result of many people standing around in queue, many people made memes while waiting:

* [This is so sad, can we put the admins in queue](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4hb3j/petition_to_put_wingzero_in_queue/)
* [MigmaBalls touches grass, comes back, and still can't play Civ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4dt80/things_ive_done_since_joining_the_queue/)

* [When you're about to get in the server](https://redd.it/v4vni7)
* [You know, it's probably a good idea to actually claim the queue, right? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v4xl8u/my_territory_fuck_off/)

## Featured Article (Reddit article)

![**Today's featured image is Shardore Tower, the Order's headquarters.**](/old/shardoretower.png)

*Today's featured image is Shardore Tower, the Order's headquarters.*

The [Order of St. Marcus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Marcus) was a builder's organization active throughout [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) that sought to create high-quality builds across the server. The Order was started in February 2018 by Gobblin and [Maester](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Maester_Alliance) Logic_Man in [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivClassic_2.0)) in honor of fellow retired Maester Marcus_Flaminius. Through the [Journey of the Placed Block,](https://reddit.com/r/stmarcus/comments/9d4v1m/journey_of_the_placed_block), the organization encouraged players to improve the looks of towns and cities across CivClassic, at a time when many buildings lacked flair. With build competitions and a point system, they called on other builders to create beautiful buildings on the server, from lowly houses to large government buildings, rail stations, libraries and more. Eleven nations on the server, most notably [Gabon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gabon), [Varkonia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varkonia), and [the Commonwealth](https://civwiki.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth) contained numerous builds which contributed to the Order's mission.
