Good morning and happy Patriot's Day from New England!

Fun fact, Patriots Day is actually a state holiday in Massachusetts, and pretty much nowhere else. I have the day off today! It's not just because of the Boston Marathon that happens today (Boston Strong!). It commemorates the first battles of the American Revolution, taking place just outside Boston in Lexington and Concord.

Speaking of battles, who's ready for some news?

This week's featured image is Altepetl, Yoahtl's capital. Honestly, this might be the best Yoahtl city to date, with large jungle vistas matching up with the towering buildings around the city as well, it's very tasteful in terms of greenery, protection, urban design and construction. Very well done and thanks to Quauhtli'n'Mia, you can't see any sign of a pigeon in this picture! Looking forward to actually taking a look at this on the server.

[**The Workers' Party**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/The_Workers'_Party) (often abbreviated **TWP**) is a communist and far-left aligned political party spanning multiple servers on Civ. Originally founded on the Golden Creeper server in Leningrad, when the nation moved to [New Leningrad](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Leningrad) on [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0), the party came along with it. It eventually morphed into other forms on [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0) and [Devoted](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Devoted) before being refounded by [SandFalls](https://civwiki.org/SandFalls) in [CivClassic 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic_2.0) in [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivClassic_2.0)), where it played a major role in its controversial elections, creating the [Confederation of Socialist Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Socialist_Augusta) and taking hold of the [Confederation of Cities, Communes, and Protectorates](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Cities_Communes_and_Protectorates), a nation composed of all the primarily communist nations on the server.

Worker's Party members consisted of any voting member in Mount Augusta residing in the country with interest in Communism, with its main goals being nationalization, anti-nationalism, anti-imperialism, worker unity and vanguardism. The Worker's Party also contributed to builds in its territories, including a large stadium in the southwest of Mount Augusta. Today the Worker's Party's successor is the [Mery Horde](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mery) on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC), however Worker's Party communes exist in [Pavia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Pavia) and [Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Danzilona).

    - While chasing them back, Yoahtl pearled Wilson for his welcome book, but he was quickly released after threats from S4NTA.

- [Mercutio and Aeros signed the Treaty of Marettimo, committing to mutual defense and infrastructure as well as common extradition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/12j51t8/treaty_of_marettimo_defensive_treaty_bw_mercutio/)

It's also discord integrated. *Crossposted from the Main Street Journal.*

## CivReign News

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/874786984835555338/1096634775470616596/2023-04-14_22.08.54.png)

*The snowy pastures of the Duchy of Courron -- so far...*

- CivReign [celebrated its Spring Festival this past weekend, encouraging players to join with a 50% boost to its mining rate](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1096176655212482640), along with an easily obtainable springsteel pickaxe, similar to moonsteel.
    - Additionally small buffs have been added to factory repairs and adamantine, among others.

However, once again *I did not get a lot of news this week!* It's definitely telling that...

- [Laurentia announced they would be moving to CivMC, joining the Imperial Federation.](https://discord.com/channels/1073671116968697927/1075791810686894131/1095383394227081347)
    - Citing "high difficulty" for newfriends along with "low activity", they've decided that it's no longer worth it to continue grinding on the server.
- It doesn't help that [the server's peak barely has reached last week's peak from the Carrot Festival](https://civmc.tk/stats). It is quite a large ask to reform the server at this rate and I know they are trying their best, but there needs to be a much bigger effort to get people back!


## Around the Civ

- [Wordbank is making a big comeback on CivMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/12ht3r6/submit_words_to_be_included_in_the_wordbank_list/), with RedDevel asking for wordbank submissions. It allows nametags that are specially colored and unique, so it'll be really cool
- [grepsedawk is campaigning for VPS to be excepted for established players](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/1095730049304506378) so it's easier to run a bot, [such as their framework, Rosegold](https://discord.gg/n9XYHJ5e) on the cloud.
- Guess what's back? [CivMC ads on r/mcservers!](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/comments/12nejzy/civmc_smproleplaypvpsemianarchy_1182nation/)
- **Return of the Civ** has continued to march on, [with a full revamp of their beta](https://discord.com/channels/1093674046069149706/1093675976925401220/1096570760383975496) following [a vote to reset the map and its plugins.](https://discord.com/channels/1093674046069149706/1093676189928923136/1096487261601800202) It's currently on its second iteration of its beta and is hoping to release the server with its current map.
- CivCivCiv [is currently contemplating changing names for the third time to the much more sensible CivCubed](https://discord.com/channels/1052830294438330419/1052837096001372200/1096440943214862389)
- Images on CivWiki are finally back following a nearly week-long outage! Honestly really pissed that [these amazing photos from last week's featured articles could barely be seen](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivWiki:Featured/April_10,_2023)

## The Fun Stuff

- Altepetl is looking beautiful, not just from the picture that was highlighted today but [a large album of pictures curated by Quauhtli'n'Mia](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/963450138192404491/1094869848686874665)

- Everybody forgets that SeldomShock is one of the great builders on Civ and is very quiet about it, so [I have to highlight his Zaros builds which have an incredible amount of detail](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/963450138192404491/1096638380382634024)

- No Mariners content this week ([besides this ridiculous dinger and a half by Jarred Kelenic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6qyuLJNLCo)), but I just want people to look [at these semi-ugly jerseys for the **Red Sox**](https://www.mlbshop.com/boston-red-sox/city-connect/t-14550797+c-0125001852+z-94-1070045514). I get it's for the Marathon, but could you have come up with a better design?
- Speaking of the Marathon, [I ran a 5K this past weekend in Boston](https://www.baa.org/races/baa-5k) too, from the same org who runs the Boston Marathon. It was amazing! If anybody cares, I did it in just under 28min, but nobody's going to care.
- For the crazy modded crowd, [Gensokyo is currently doing a playthrough of Enigmatica 9](https://discord.com/channels/290489032633352211/290489602354184193/1096238754819211308). Probably have to ask them for pal again so I can just play the funny modded
