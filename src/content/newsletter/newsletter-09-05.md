Good morning and happy Monday and Labor Day from New England! Another fantastic day for reporting on marginally important news from a niche political Minecraft server!

Quite a different week in terms of news, definitely a lot quieter than I was expecting, so it's nice to have a change of pace this week? Who knows, I was volunteering for most of the week and not really paying attention that much on Civ. Anyway, here's the news...

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is Provence, a developing city within Lusitania. Over the course of the last few weeks Rekt_Tangle has been building the area up with brand new areas sort of evocative of a northern Italian style, including a trolley, a roman way, markets, and much more all seamlessly integrated into the landscape.

### Featured Article

[**Carson**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Carson_(Civcraft)) was one of the most influential cities in [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0), serving as a landmark for both cultural and economic activity on the server. The country was highlighted by its large city sunken into the ocean. By the server's end, the city was built up with large skyscrapers where many of its cooperatives were headquartered. The city operated using different cooperative companies to further the country's growth. Among notable cooperatives was Carson Infrastructure Corporation (CIC), which dug and built a large network of international underground rails stretching across the server. Its additional claim in the nether also played a large part during the [Nox](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Nox_War) and [Titan](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Titan_War) wars.

Carson's legacy lives on in many aspects of the Civ genre, while many notable residents would go on to become admins in future servers (notably, Jacinth_Joy on [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0) and iebagi on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic)), its city's design as a stronghold in the middle of the ocean has inspired new iterations like [CivCorp](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivCorp) in [CivRealms](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms), and [CivMarket](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMarket) in [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC), while its rail design has influenced future rail projects like the [HITS](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HITS) and the [Great Overland Railway.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_Overland_Railway) [**(Full article...)**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Carson_(Civcraft))

- Blockchainistan has [continued to deny efforts of aiding Rhode Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x1plxo/update_on_the_titan_vs_buildfriend_war/), but "routed" Titan after stopping a skybridge attempt and winning a PvP battle.
    - Later that week, Blockchainistan [unilaterally "unclaimed" Titan Industries and IMC land](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x45qi7/peace_in_our_time/), and a new country named Lemuria immediately claimed land in the process.

- Speaking of spurious land claims, the Imperial Federation [overclaimed Hyperborean Federation land](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x1vq7l/map_of_newly_formulated_imperial_federation/), while the latter [confirmed their use of the land.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x1y7t6/all_area_outlined_in_black_is_hereby_claimed_by/), with a map [published soon after.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x2067e/map_of_the_hyperboreaon_confederation_current/)

- Danzilona's [September elections](https://civwiki.org/wiki/September_2022_Danzilonan_general_election) resulted in a complete sweep with all positions up for election being won by Des23.


### Server-Related News

As this newsletter is intended to cover all Civ events, this section is dedicated to mostly non-CivMC news.

- CivMC leadership have come increasingly under fire this week.
    - Without announcement, many players from Rhode Island [have been seemingly banned.](https://discord.com/channels/962128222240243712/1004536259617767494/1015139982773588028) No reasons for the bans have been made public.
    - meat312 has called out the admins' policy, [citing transparency issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x47e4i/discussion_around_civmc_and_ban_policies/), something that has been lacking in both development and moderation decisions.
    - RektTangle's normal brewery clue was cancelled as [he called out admins for unreasonable treatment while he was a developer working on Brewery;](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x2elr8/rekts_brewery_clue_is_on_strike_for_real_this_week/) SoundTech argued about his personal character, especially when quitting, but [both sides seem to have conflicting views on the subject.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x2elr8/rekts_brewery_clue_is_on_strike_for_real_this_week/imiyulo/)
    - Tvman pointed out that [many server promotional posters were actually false](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x3evhm/remember_when_this_was_posted_wonder_how_that/).
- CivVie has [finally launched their beta server to selected participants](https://discord.com/channels/986025909154897971/986360054779355167/1015277447115194398), with community admins responding quickly to suggestions.
- CivReign has [made a large announcement about their plans for their upcoming server](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1014566020729548851), with many CivRealms-like mechanics returning as well as seasons within Realistic Biomes, a "fingerprinting" mechanic to track players, and the return of Nether Factories. They've also announced a build contest at the end of the month.

## Motivating Cry for Help

![](https://i.redd.it/lqk91fx2mrk91.jpg)

*This section's featured picture is an Icenian propaganda poster of the current war and their continued efforts to supply materials and recover from previous attacks.*

Thanks for reading this week's newsletter, I'm still extremely shocked about the support this newsletter and the survey has gotten over this past week.

A couple action points to look out for:

- **Answer this [short recruitment survey](https://forms.gle/LXopzzH3rj5aeXUc6) if you haven't already!**
- I'm looking for **featured article submissions** since I am fresh out of ideas. **[Submit this form here if you want to highlight any Civ history you're proud of!](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)**

Thanks to Gjum and GetSkinny for proofreading this week.

And as always...
