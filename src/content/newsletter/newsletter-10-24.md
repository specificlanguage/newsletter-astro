Good morning and happy Monday from New England! Is it almost spooky time yet?

Hope you've been having a good week connecting rails and bringing both things and people together. I'm very glad there continues to be opportunities for Civ players to gather in game in both Danzilona and Pavia, to name a few. Obviously, someone mentioned something about Olympics and I tried to highlight it a week or two ago, but it's all good.

Not much from my front this week, I was mostly worried about a stupid writing midterm in my international relations class. But who cares, onto the news!

This week's featured image is of Estalia's currently under-construction rail station and market at 0,0. Although you're viewing the market as of right now, the megastructure's progress is coming along incredibly fast thanks to help from many other nations, especially with a build party this past weekend. It's intended to become a grand successor to Gmall. Great work!

[**Alexandria**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Alexandria), officially the **Free City of Alexandria**, was a country on [CivRealms](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms) self-described as "founded with the desire to provide a friendly place for newfriends to learn about basic server mechanics and the history of the server". Growing from a Brewer's Guild, the city became the serverâ€™s most populous area, it seceded from [Varathia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varathia) due to its growing population. It became implicated in many wars throughout the server's history, such as the [Ez2War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Ez2War) and being involved in minor conflicts in the [USA War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/USA_War).

The main building in the city was the Newfriend Manor, intended as an entry point for newfriends to be introduced to the [mechanics and plugins](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mechanics_and_Plugins) on the server. Among other landmarks in the city are the Statue of Athena, Temple of Sarapis, Ampitheatre, and the Lighthouse. Like many other countries, the country held territory in CivRealms' various expansions, in this case, Solitude in the [Thomas Archipelago](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Thomas_Archipelago). The country served as a quality example for [newfriend](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Jargon#Newfriend) orientation, however no direct successor in [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC) was created.

### Borian Crisis
- [A voice chat was shown](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y7cudf/borianlivesmatter/) with an Imperial Federation leader perceiving Borians as those "lower class". (This was largely intended as a joke, as Thorian people were already being treated equally.)
  - During the leaked video, CJTheKing12345 set off TNT during a government meeting and killed four players. More TNT was placed below the building as well.
  - As a result, CJTheKing and Swampbog [were declared as wanted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y6udd2/wanted_for_crimes_against_the_if/) for "being a sore loser".
  - Despite this, [CJ declared that he did nothing wrong.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y6ol98/my_message/)
  - The Blue Cross (formerly known as the [Red Cross](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8e8il/due_to_blue_being_my_favorite_colour_and_totally/)) [backed the Borians](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8cwwj/the_red_cross_recognises_the_borian_genocide_and/), stating that it was a genocide and Imperial legislators should repeal this policy.
  - Thankfully, after a few days, [Thorians declared the Imperial Federation had recognized their plight](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y9lyj0/peace_between_the_if_and_the_thorian_people/), integrating them into the Federation and reaffirming to treat them equally.

### Other Drama

- In other drama news, the nation of Ostersund claimed that [Hyperborean leader Spaceman_Spleef was not allowing them to become independent](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8g40q/freeostersund/), despite being allowed to do so in the constitution.
  - This became an ongoing discussion within the Confederation, eventually resulting in [the Pact of the Hyperborean Brotherhood](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/yblu3j/pact_of_the_hyperborean_brotherhood/), essentially breaking the area into states with relative autonomy.
  - Eventually, Federation of [Esberg-Ostersund joined the **Imperial** Federation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/ybv8pb/federation_of_esbergostersund_joins_the_if/), suggesting that Hyperborea rule was incredibly disliked.
- [Hg_80, binchymonkey and HaroldtheHog were banned from the Temporal Isles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/yagcyi/the_ban_of_hg_80_binchymonkey_and/) after placing some grief. Comments indicate a PvP fight broke out.
- Mery citizens were concerned after Pavian officials entered their land and began building. [It turned out it was part of a Pavian infrastructure project](https://twitter.com/PavianOutpost/status/1584231961526431746), hoping to expand out to rest of the Lyrean Community. *Crossposted from the Pavian Outpost.*
- Additionally, the Crown Prince is facing a crisis [as citizens are dying in the country due to starvation](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/971089862931386409/1033006657002807386), with citizens clamoring for better access to food.

### Other Happenings

- [SPQR and the newly formed Taiga Kingdom signed the Treaty of Labux](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y9q4ms/treaty_of_labux/), committing to judicial and defensive friendship.
- [Nipplerock leader Gantoe arrived in Icenia and unilaterally annexed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y7upkh/nipplerock_annexes_icenia/)
  - This was quickly followed up by [Gantoe blowing up the train station](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8vl8q/nipplerock_destroys_vital_ice_town_infastructure/) with ChrisChrispie saying ["I hope we reinforced that."](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8vl8q/nipplerock_destroys_vital_ice_town_infastructure/)

Many however, were confused and wanted clarification from the admins on who was banned, and who should be.
- [CivReign's latest teaser](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1032339406809473064) highlights the overhaul of farming and crops with the introduction of seasons, a much-hypothesized system of crop balancing that is finally being implemented.

### Number 4 is a Masterpiece!

This week's multimedia entries saw very many entries to Southshire's [CivBall halloween contest,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y8ge6e/civball_halloween_costume_contest/) where the winner would get a hefty prize of a stack of diamond blocks. I would highlight them but I want to eventually highlight the winner, if there is one. Among my favorites:

Sorry for getting a little clickbaity in that last second, I just thought it was funny.

Thank you to Get_Skinny for proofreading this week and many thanks to all the contributors who are doing great work the newsletter. It's shocking to me how much support this has gotten over the last *checks calendar* 23 weeks, so **if you want to contribute to the news (especially Featured Articles), please do so at [this google form](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9),** lest a vampire comes sleeping in your bed and sucks your will to play Civ out of you.

Haha, not like that would ever happen anyways. In any case...
