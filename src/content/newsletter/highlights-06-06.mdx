Good morning from California!

My vacation isn't quite over yet, so this is a *highlights* over the past two weeks rather than an actual newsletter. I figured after the past couple of weeks, *something* should sum up the past week or so.

The highlights are intended to be a shorter format than the newsletter; this will solely focus on the single featured article that week, and the current events in an *extremely short* bullet point format. So:
- no big explanation sections,
- few pictures,
- no crazy game highlights,
- no polls,
- no fun stuff (including build or map highlights),
- no op-eds, and most importantly
- no baseball bulletpoints.

If people like this in the future, I might run this alongside the regular newsletter, since [I'm essentially copy-pasting this against the current events on the front page of the CivWiki.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivWiki:Featured)

*This week's featured image is Aeros' enchanted city.*

## Featured Article

![](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/f/fc/Empty_Promises_13_excerpt.png)

[**Empty Promises**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Empty_Promises) was a Civ magazine that highlighted articles, news, columns, interviews, cartoons, and other affairs related to Civ. Occasionally published by Dr_Oracle throughout the later years of [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft) and in [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic), it was frequently marketed as "Civ's longest running newspaper/magazine/bad joke". Its main selling points were its high effort to design along with its commitment to investigative journalism, generally well received by the community. It often tackled challenging subjects, such as Nether Factories drama and recovery efforts during the late years of the [Titan](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Titan_War) and [HCF wars](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HCF_War) in Civcraft, and featuring or interviewing figures like [sintralin](https://civwiki.org/wiki/sintralin) and [bgbba](https://civwiki.org/wiki/bgbba) during the [Somber War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Somber_War) giving both perspectives of the war's outbreak.

Empty Promises was unique as it was one of the only fully compiled, true-to-its-form, and sometimes open-sourced Civ magazines; many Civ newspapers today only focus on current events and rarely run interviews, op-eds, features, or showcases about items that had little to do with current events. [Dr_Oracle](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Dr_Oracle) has since gone inactive, although occasionally played in the [Augustan Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Augustan_Federation) in its later days.

## Postscripts

This is just my area to do the plugs:

- [**Please compete in the newsletter's screenshot competition!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/13duu08/picture_competition_for_the_newsletter/)
    - It's literally super easy
    - **There are few submissions so you can win very easily**
    - You can dig up a build screenshot that you posted on Reddit from months ago
    - You can find something in your screenshots folder that had anything to do with a war
    - There's a monetary prize of $25 winner/$10 runner-up
    - It's due **June 19** (even longer than June 12, so even more time to build stupid crap)
- [Contribute a featured article](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9),
    - It's quite simple as you just nominate an article and/or
    - give a writeup for an article that should be featured

I'm also probably still going to just do Highlights on June 12, so no newsletter next week. I promise that June 19 will be an actual newsletter, and will possibly cover everything in the past three weeks.
