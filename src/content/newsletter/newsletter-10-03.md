Good morning and happy Monday from New England! I'm not slowing down on the newsletter front, but last week just tired me out for no reason -- I haven't been playing Civ as much as I'd like personally, but that's a me problem I think. At least that makes me impartial to pretty much every news ever.

Sorry for the quick blurb, I didn't have a lot of time to write something new and I'm way too tired to write new material out on a Sunday night. But are you ready for the news?

This week's featured image is the exterior of the Market Curia within SPQR's city, Roma. SPQR's involvement in the Estalia--Rhode Island War forced them to pause development on their city, but now they're rapidly building out, using large-scale, classical Roman designs for their country's builds. The country traces its origins all the way back to Civcraft 1.0, the country is planning to hold the Festival of Saturnalia in December and several sporting events next year.

[**Snitches**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Snitch) are special blocks used in Civ servers which players and groups can place to record and relay actions of other players within the block's vicinity. The mechanic is enabled using a plugin called [**JukeAlert**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Snitch). There are two types used: Noteblocks, which can only output player entry, while more powerful jukeboxes can log nearly every interaction. This simple tool has allowed players to conduct surveillance of cities and builds, and is commonplace on Civ for monitoring builds and defensive structures for grief.

In conjunction with [Citadel](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Citadel), JukeAlert and snitches have been a staple of security and protection on Civ-genre servers and its mechanics have been relatively unchanged. Due to its simple nature, players have made numerous tools for players to view and interact logs in many different fashions, from in-game mods like Gjum's [SnitchMod](https://github.com/Gjum/SnitchMod/) as well as out-of-game tools like [Kira](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Kira), a discord relay for snitch groups.
