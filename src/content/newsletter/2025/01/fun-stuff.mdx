import {getEntry} from "astro:content";

This section corresponds to "[the Fun Stuff](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-12-24-2024/#the-fun-stuff)" on the previous newsletters. I love finding fun things that people make on Civ, it really is one of the main ways I find Civ an amazing community -- collectively we're all crazy but in concert it's a really smart, funny and creative community that has really cool ideas.

Who am I kidding, writing a long speech for this section? No way. This entire article will literally just be links, LOL.

The only thing that's going to get changed from this version of the Fun Compilation to the previous is that I will no longer be putting build pictures in this section anymore; if you've noticed, those have been sprinkled throughout the rest of the newsletter's features.

## Cool Content

![](https://i.imgur.com/3aSQUVu.png)

*A foggy dawn in Novobirisk. (cr: _Rakija_)*

- I am excepting this single build render because [being able to show an entire country, let alone Pavia-Griffin, within a single render is a very pleasing thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i9xzfv/sunrise_over_pavia_griffin/) and probably took a lot of GPU (cr: Seekinq)
- Another [big ass map from TheJmqn showcasing the claims of the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hq7jqt/civmc_unofficial_claims_map_33_too_big_to_fail_as/). Are we really on Map 33? (cr: TheJmqn)
- While technically the presence of the wojaks make this a meme, I find it an [ironic piece of art of the depiction of Squid pearling Arconis during the war](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i7ts5q/squid_pearls_arconis_during_the_thats_nuts_war/) (cr: Ironscale)
- It's [really cool to see a guide on how to make those cool notes on paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hy7f40/heres_a_short_tutorial_on_making_and_testing_json/), going to make things so much easier. Not to mention did someone say currency?! (cr: Milipede/Book_Bot)
- Speaking of guides, [very nice to see someone make a guide on smooth movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hxwwng/reference_for_smooth_camera_movement_in_jsmacros/) which is really a guide on making a bot bypass anticheat (cr: x1025)
- Mazes are not often a thing on modern Minecraft, which is why [it's a little surprising Fredhun decided to do one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hzcvnn/introducing_freds_maze/). I'm glad it [was so well received](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i9swyh/freds_maze_victors_found/)! (cr: Fredhun)
- [This silent retelling of Cissonius](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1icvsq3/a_enthralling_story/) deferring to the demons satisfied my TikTok brain, editing 100, well done, no notes (cr: ToonyLinkSR)
- A [really well made poster that's totally not a threat at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ic0l93/schizo_tech_poster/) (cr: Innatree)
- [It's literally just a video of Amber's coronation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1huaq0y/coronation_of_the_first_pavian_empress/), but videos get you pretty far in the Civ world, lol (cr: Jaydon)
- Not only are these nice pictures, but [this Exyria ad is extremely well formatted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hztalo/new_players_welcome_in_exyria/) (cr: Forged)
- As a Pavian, [I cannot disregard the high production quality of the Bedford Herald's Coronation Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hvefxd/bedford_herald_special_coronation_edition/) (cr: SteelHand7)

- [Cue xfiles theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i34wth/coincidence/) (cr: Da_duckTV)

## Metagame Highlights

![](https://i.imgur.com/unYDPFV.png)

*Moonlight seeping in at San Rafael in the Karydian Union, Imperial Federation (cr: Mat_Potato_King)*

- It's great to see that [someone notices that CivMC has been actually low-key popping off lately](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i1v3yp/civmc_golden_age/), even if it's gradual at best
- Actually it's hilarious that people downvote Khalkedonia so much that [they forced someone to write a post asking why it's so bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ib4nnj/whats_wrong_with_khalkedonia/), even though it literally isn't. You guys are awful at answering questions lol
- xFier has built https://civmap.com, a completely new map site that [can display maps within *almost* real time on a weekly cadence](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1idvkl8/late_stage_mapitalism/). I talked to him about some of the technical details behind it offline, and honestly **really cool** to see a fully featured map website that's an evolution of things we saw on previous iterations. Amazing work!
- [ChrisChrispie asked where the oldfriend cutoff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ie20nx/what_is_the_oldhead_cutoff/). If you had to ask me, I'd say "it's when I started".
- Well, [at least the quitting post is alive and well on Civ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1i1devk/goodbye_civ/)

## Non-Civ Content

LOL, look at this dumb idiot keeping the Non-Civ content section on a *Civ* newsletter. At the very least, this is the least likely place anyone looks in the newsletter anyway, so chances are you're only looking at this section because you really want to.

- My new price sucking addiction are mechanical keyboards, unfortunately. I have dropped [\$220 on a BEAUTIFUL Keychron Q6 Max](https://i.imgur.com/BHoEv2d.jpeg) and it's so much better than the old keyboard I've been using to write this newsletter for years (also pictured).
  - It is so good that by complete accident, it's become my daily driver for WORK even though I literally bought it for personal reasons.
  - Do I need to buy another keyboard to actually replace the other one I need to use? Bad financial decisions possibly incoming...
- I must point out that [I met Lambat leader Kaprediem in real life during my trip to the Philippines](https://i.imgur.com/7Mv0mwd.jpeg). Thank you for this amazing honor (and sincere apologies for making you hike out to Quezon City)
- I have made it a goal to write in my physical journal EVERY DAY for the entire year. We are on to 30 days straight, and for me, it's a very nice way to unwind and reflect on the day, and I write about 2 pages worth. I do use a couple apps just to track this habit once it's done -- [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) and [!Habits](https://www.notboring.software/product/habits) -- but nothing crazy.
- For the two small sports things I want to talk about:
  - The Los Angeles Dodgers have become the Golden State Warriors of Baseball, now that [they basically have every free agent in the fucking world](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/roki-sasaki-explains-why-he-chose-the-dodgers-what-role-shohei-ohtani-played-in-his-decision/)
  - I also cannot believe that history is also repeating itself in football as well. Oh boy, I can't wait for Taylor Swift's boyfriend to win *another* Super Bowl ring, and Philadelphia to be absolutely trashed for the third year in a row, and also Drake to get absolutely destroyed on a national level

I also want to make a brief apology for getting this edition out on pretty much the last day I could in January. A lot of things happened IRL for me -- I got sick around the 20th, I was oncall for the last week, there were a lot of things really stopping me from getting things done. I apologize if you really wanted this sooner, but I'll put myself on a better standard for next month!
