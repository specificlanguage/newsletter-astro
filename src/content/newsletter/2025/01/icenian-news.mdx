It is with great excitement that we unveil the very first edition of CivMC Local News—your
dedicated source for stories, events, and updates from our vibrant community. This marks the
beginning of what we hope will be a long-standing tradition of keeping you informed, inspired,
and connected.

Our mission is simple: to celebrate the people, places, and projects that make CivMC truly
unique. In this inaugural issue, we bring you highlights from recent developments, interviews
with local leaders, and a look into upcoming events that are sure to capture your interest.
This milestone would not have been possible without the support and enthusiasm of our
community members. Thank you for embarking on this journey with us. Together, we will craft a
newspaper that reflects the diverse voices and dynamic spirit of CivMC.

Here’s to the start of something extraordinary!

## Stocks

XP prices are at 2.4d, which is 70% higher than November 2024. Is this a sign of impending inflation in our nation?

## Politics

The general election in Icenia is imminent and everyone is required to register to vote. As of writing, places to register include the Statue Of Liberty, Blue Cove and the AP. In other politics news, Icenia has a new flag. You could say that blob is the new circle! The new flag, which is similar to the old one, has a small, tumor like growth on the top left. Civilians have divided opinions on this matter.

### Bill of the Tabloid!

This tabloid’s chosen bill is an amendment to Article IV, Section (a). It proposes a change to
speed up the legislative process. It introduces two key changes:

1. Override Vote for Constitutional Amendments

An override vote (which is a vote 85% or more in favor) can now only be applied to
  constitutional amendments if it is unanimous.

2. Automatic Veto Clause

If the president does not approve or veto a bill within 5 days after it meets the voting threshold, it is automatically vetoed.

All in all, these changes put together aim to prevent delays in government decision making and also speed up the implementation of important bills.

## The Courtrooms

1. *Shadno vs. \_SSG\_*

Shadno is taking _SSG_ to the court rooms as they feel that _SSG_ violated Article VII of the
constitution by “brutally killing all of the sniffers” in their garden. _SSG_ is planning on getting
a lawyer for this case and Kingstell is looking to start the trial soon

2. *Lopster Bisque v Icenian Government*

Lopster wanted to sue the government due to a lack of payment after expanding the city’s
vault on 19/10/24. This case was shortly dropped after a member of the government paid the
wages owed.
