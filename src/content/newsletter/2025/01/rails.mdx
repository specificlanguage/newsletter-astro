Many of us have been there—you join a Civ server, receive a spawn book and a minecart, and eventually find yourself at a vast, bewildering rail station. You stare at a sign with the famous **/dest commands**, growing increasingly confused. You ask in global chat how it works, only to receive a stream of vague or unhelpful answers. Eventually, you log off, never to return.

In this article, I argue for the return of the one true rail system: **direct lines**.

Over time, the Civ genre has experimented with various destination systems, most of which rely on the [**RailSwitch**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/RailSwitch) plugin. Some of the most infamous include (ranked from worst to slightly acceptable):

- [**KANI** (Knot and Nexus Interchange, CivClassic 2.0)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/KANI_Rail_System)
- [**AURA** (AUtomatic Rail Assistance, CivClassic 2.0)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/AURA)
- [**OneDest** (formerly known as SARS—an analogy to a viral respiratory disease, CivMC)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/OneDest)
- [**HITS** (Hjaltland-Impasse Transportation Service, CivClassic 2.0)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HITS)
- [**GOR** (Great Overland Railway, CivMC & CivClassic 2.0)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_Overland_Railway)

For a visual representation of this chaos, look no further than KANI’s coverage at CivClassics’ EOTW — **pure hell**.

All of these systems were built with good intentions: the world is vast, rail lines are costly and time-consuming to dig, and efficiency is key. What if we could minimise these efforts and **interconnect the world**? A noble goal, certainly, but one that comes with serious drawbacks. Destination systems must be adopted, maintained, and standardised across a server, requiring extensive cooperation. In practice, this leads to several problems—problems that are all too evident on **CivMC** today.

---

## The Three Problems of Destination Systems

### 1. **Maintainability**
A new server launches, excitement is high, and an ambitious network of **/dests** is constructed. Fast forward two years—**OneDest is barely maintained**. Occasionally, some dedicated soul appears to patch a few lines, but these efforts are **rare**. Most of the time, the system slowly degrades, leaving players with broken routes and confusion.

### 2. **Effort & Exploitation**
Direct rail lines require immense effort. Many stretch **thousands of blocks**, taking weeks to construct with contributions from multiple people. But imagine the frustration of discovering that **someone has hijacked your rail to add a dest**, diverting traffic through their own rail network—**a modern form of rail leeching**. A system designed to be universal instead becomes a battleground for control.

### 3. **Inaccessibility**
Destination systems are **only convenient for those who already understand them**. To travel, you must either:

- Use an **external map** ([CivMC Rail Map](https://civmc-map.github.io))
- Consult a **third-party website** ([KANI Route Calculator](https://amel.pw/kani/))
- Memorise **a labyrinth of commands**

For new players, this is an **intimidating and unnecessary hurdle**. Rather than simply hopping on a rail and enjoying the journey, they must **learn the complexities of RailSwitch**, forcing them **out of the game and onto external tools**. Many never return.

## The Solution: Direct Rail Lines

There is one alternative that solves all these issues: **direct lines without destinations**.

- **Maintainable** – No reliance on complex systems; a rail line is simply a rail line.
- **Tamper-proof** – No one can hijack or redirect a route without physically altering the tracks - a pearlable offense.
- **Accessible** – Anyone, new or old, can simply **board a minecart and ride** without needing a manual.

More than that, **direct lines encourage exploration**. There is nothing more satisfying than discovering a city, choosing a rail line with an intriguing flag, and simply **seeing where it leads**. By knowing the dest upfront, you already know where you're going, taking away the magic of discovery. The **true** way for new players to integrate into the server—by is by travelling the world naturally, not by staring at a command list.

If we want Civ servers to be **welcoming, sustainable, and fun**, it’s time to abandon the tangled mess of **destination systems** and return to the **golden age of direct rail lines**.
