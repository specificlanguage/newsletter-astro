CivMC closes the chapter on its second full year, a year which saw incredible economic developments partly due to widespread peace.

2024 witnessed Monument Bank becoming one of the undeniable staples of the server economy, within which the formation of the genre's first formal stock market took place this year, with seven companies going public.

The Tool market became crowded, with Raven Raiments and Icenia Industries joining the fray alongside Tusk Armory, these companies have driven prices down whilst also expanding serverwide access to enchanted tools through international outlets in most major cities.

The rise of a gambling frenzy took ahold of many players, with a myriad of companies taking advantage. The collosal Tusk-ran US Election lottery in November saw 10,000 diamonds changing hands, and their regular poker nights ensured that the usual addicts got their fix.

Inroads were made into the map-art making process, decreasing the production cost and reducing the price for consumers - With cities across the server becoming covered in unique and creative arts never seen before, showing the impact that peace can have on economic innovation.

I look forward to keeping you up to date, month on month, with the economic developments of CivMC!
