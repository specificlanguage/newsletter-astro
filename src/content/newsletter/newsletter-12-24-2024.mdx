Good morning and merry Christmas!

Well, this is it folks, this is the **final** weekly newsletter you're going to see pinned on the CivMC subreddit. After **two and a half years and 127 newsletters**, this era is coming to a bittersweet close as I intend to move onto a few bigger and better things.

I won't be going away in the community, but as my IRL responsibilities and activities have just gotten more busy -- not to mention this newsletter writing process has become generally unsustainable -- the end of the year seems a fitting time to say goodbye to everyone. While this will be a pretty normal newsletter, I have a couple of small additions along the way.

For one final time... let's get to the news:

## Featured

Shockton has the honor of being the final cover image for the weekly newsletter. Although it has the virtue of it being winter-themed and snowy -- it is the Christmas season after all -- the decorations are probably some of the most indepth and high-effort among the server. I always enjoyed visiting the town with its distinct landmarks and tropical feel; one location of what I would consider to be a great representative of Civ.

### Featured Article

![](https://i.imgur.com/n72mrpi.png)

**[CivWiki](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivWiki)** is a website for the Civ genre of Minecraft servers, self-described as "document[ing Civ] servers, the mechanics that drive them, and the rise and fall of their players and civilizations." Motivated by a lack of wiki and server documentation following the demise of CivCraft, the site originally emerged as solely documenting [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) during its launch in 2017. It eventually expanded its scope after merging with the [CivRealms](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms) Wiki in 2020 and obtaining the [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft) Wiki archives in 2021 (with archival efforts from the [Maester Alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Maester_Alliance)).

CivWiki has also had the benefit of many memes, including "edit civwiki", following the result of people calling others delusional in CivClassic; several memes were created for people which spread the meme. In 2023, with [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC)'s launch, the CivWiki also made an effort to reformat its pages for its server; today the site is the leading authority on Civ history, along with supporting other efforts around documenting Civ history, like the Newsletter. CivWiki is always looking for editors, and welcomes new players to edit on their own nations and improve existing ones, including those [pages still from Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=&namespace=3002), [highly requested pages](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Special:WantedPages), or [documenting events that have very little context.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/SEC%E2%80%93Gang_Shi_War)

  - The Elysian Pact's yearly Christmas photo [was interrupted by an explosion that killed 31](https://civwiki.org/wiki/2023_Pavia_Christmas_Bombing), leaving highly valuable items idle in Pavia. <EdNote>We'll get to that soon enough!</EdNote>

## The News

*SPQR's Coliseum outfitted for the holiday season (cr: alberb96)*

### Around the Server

Is this the year we don't have a war on the server before Christmas?

- Pavia uncovered that CivMC admin RedDevel was behind last year's Christmas holiday attacks.
  - [Cissonius and the Coast Guard](https://i.imgur.com/AEZAwQP.png) were notified by Complexii that RedDevel had supplied the explosion materials.
  - The country then issued an ultimatum seeking the CivMC admin's pearl for crimes against Christmas.
  - He surrendered [after the effort of several other players](https://i.imgur.com/XbNFiz4.png) fought against them.
- Pavia additionally [announced they were signing a CUB Friendship agreement with Rivia](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoWfmYM_vXzq4heYLZampTDB3NpMoFJE/view?usp=sharing), extending their influence into the southeast.

  - Khalkedonia cited "inappropriate behavior" and [harrassment](https://i.imgur.com/6Hv5h3V.png) of a player in Khalkedonia telling people unaliving speech <EdNote>Sorry, just trying to be politically correct while on Christmas Eve!</EdNote>
  - While specifics haven't been disclosed, it has generally something to do with harrassing, and a completely [separate issue on ToonySR's pearling](https://i.imgur.com/J8cUOqS.png).

- A follow-up post [was created by Alaska regarding the raids on Novosiborisk.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hg4x3z/informational_post_regarding_the/)

Not90 [further clarified they were not blaming anybody in Fempire.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hg4x3z/informational_post_regarding_the/m2i2hpo/)

- Active players will know that I went halfway across the world for the holidays. Normally this would be extremely painful but this time I was in business class with lie-flat seats, so it was at least much better.
- The Red Sox signing [Walker Buehler](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/walker-buehler-red-sox-agree-to-deal-right-hander-heading-to-boston-after-dodgers-title/) is kinda insane -- glad that the Mariners didn't trade away Luis Castillo there though too.

Last week, we had **35 responses.**

### Best Ad Strategies, 2024 Edition

![](https://i.imgur.com/LIcsCli.png)

I revisted some of the older newsletters and this seemed to be a relatively interesting question, so I decided to bring it back for this week. Nothing has really changed here though, I would imagine people think that clicking on more engaging nation ads and essays would bring more people regardless. Having these on in the background is a typical thing that I do.

I added one category this time around compared to the previous time, which was "Informational shorts" -- what I envisioned it were [those kinds of shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ps-EsHxu81I) that are informational, but are basically geared towards virality because they show "weird" stuff or whatever. I like these too, which is also sort of why I asked about this. Shorts/TikToks are definitely something that Civ can exploit, of which I've only seen [one Civ player attempt to use](https://www.tiktok.com/@orestraya/video/7196795474634968322). It's a tough format to get right though.

### Hot Takes

I did a whole writeup on nearly every hot take while I was stuck in the airport, but in the interest of your sanity, I have broken this out into a whole separate article so you don't have to endure a mess of a writeup.

<FeatureLink
  feature={await getEntry('extras', 'hot-takes')}
  arrowDirection="right"
/>

However, here's a few highlights:

> Admins SHOULD be pushing meta changing features as often as they want to play around with mechanics. Playerbase hate it? Revert. Else we will be stuck in the same dull server until Wing finishes a new and revamped sneaker collection of his own and closes the server.

This was a sentiment that really counters the idea of the admin's strategy on the Meteoric Iron update. I mentioned in a previous poll writeup that while it's not a satisfying thing where admins just throw a significant update onto prod without any feedback, but sometimes this is what you need to get new features out the door these days.

In typical Civ mainstream cycles, "meta changing features" would usually be developed by an experimental server, typically Realms or Devoted, but CivMC seems to be the sole server this cycle, so it tends to be difficult to play both the mainstay of the iteration and the driver of new ideas.

> Winning a civ war through a ban wave or insiding is pathetic. People that have insided like ComradeNick, FastestGrass, Antea, now have zero trust within the community.

I don't agree on the pathetic, but extremely tragic. I've already talked about ban waves (in the longer writeup), but insiding especially in the Grasslands Gambit was especially damaging to the community. It just really feels bad when you're just entirely sidelined in the community and not even have a chance to redeem yourself.

> not everything needs to be botted and sometimes the admins lean too hard into the bunkies crowd

> Being a vault friend is a wasteful and unnecessary part of Civ

> Vault warfare, as is, permanently relegated Civcraft into a very small niche that will always be small

It doesn't really help the tech tree is so heavily imbalanced towards just climbing up, rather than out. It would be nice in future Civ servers to completely overhaul the tech tree in order so that something like this just simply doesn't exist and allow nations to have better specializations, but because defense is the gameplay on Civ, one can dream.

> You haven’t truly experienced civ if you’ve stuck to one player ‘archetype’. If you were always the grinder, always the pvper or always the builder you have only experienced a small part of civ.

The one thing I will say about being a newsletter writer is that it's definitely opened me up to so many different parts of the world. I can at least say that I'm at least a little more versed in how PvP and strategy works instead of it being a black box. I think this iteration more so has allowed people to really discover what they can really bring to the table; it's really the culmination of every "fun" feature that Civ has brought to the table thus far.

## What Do I Read Now?

![](https://i.imgur.com/xin8DDf.jpeg)

*Exyria's palace in their citadel (cr: me).*

So, if you've been a longtime reader you're probably reading this section, but [this will become a more feature-heavy newsmagazine](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-12-16-2024/#new-format), although all items you know and love will remain. However, what happens when you want to get your weekly dose of news?

Luckily, **I have a writeup from Pandastical about what might be pretty good to read!**

<FeatureLink
  feature={await getEntry('extras', 'journalism-on-civ')}
  arrowDirection="right"
/>

This above, is sort of the kind of content you're going to be seeing on the new monthly newsletter anyway.
But, as a short summary of what you might want to look at:

- **The [Bedford Herald](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hgh3og/bedford_herald_second_issue_renovations/)** has a production value that's much similar to mine from a design perspective, however it mostly covers Pavia internal affairs. It even has a lottery every week for those who complete the week's puzzle!
- **[The Diamond Chronicler](https://discord.gg/gBxFUTpV68)** is typically where I get my news from Karydia & the IF. While it's entirely Discord-based, the journalism is very good and does a great job involving its readership and holding events.
- I will be anticipating more content coming out of the [**AP News Company**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hh9r4k/announcing_the_ap_media_company/), which will mainly be covering more Alenarith- and Icenia-based affairs but somewhat covering the whole server.
- The **[Imperial Times](https://discord.gg/F6hrDwMqu7)** is something that was much more active over the summer -- however it seems that Codey has returned and hopefully will be pumping out more high-quality video-based broadcasts once again, covering news across the entire server but focused on the IF.
- If you prefer a more long-form podcast-type, **[CivTalk](https://discord.gg/Q4fBPdT6)** might be the media of choice for you, as Arx is spinning up this podcast and has a couple of episodes out at the time of writing.

Of course, I will be continuing this newsletter as previously mentioned before, as a **monthly newsmagazine** if you decide to stick around anyway -- mostly will be doing the same as before, however, you might not see the amount of frequency and pull this used to have.

## One Final Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/e6o3ESe.jpeg)

*It's me, in my newsletter office, as I finish writing this last weekly newsletter.*

Thank you, so very much, for reading to the very end of this newsletter.

We've come to the end of the line, everyone. I want to get something clear that I **loved** doing this newsletter weekly, even despite the pain and troubles and all that kind of stuff.

---

There's quite a lot of people I'd like to thank for helping me with this newsletter throughout the years:

- **BritishWanderer** has been one of my most consistent supporters, whether through funding the newsletter through the Monument Bank's ads, or helping me write articles last minute, I cannot be more thankful for your help, both for your efforts and as a friend.
- **Gjum and Lodish**, thank you for really supporting me during the early days of the newsletter and proofreading through really late nights with their comprehensive Civ knowledge.
- **Xcios** for having the amazing idea for running regular polls on the newsletter, it has been an immense help towards the newsletter's engagement
- The members of the dubbed "newsletter mafia" who helped review the newsletters during most of the newsletter's run: **Creepi0n, GetSkinny, RedDevel, reffelruz, animeme_master, Metrix, ShadySauce and Xcios**
- **Hitobashuru/Nat** for designing some simple branding for this newsletter on the pictures that I've still been using to this day

Finally, if you've reached the end of the newsletter, spend some time with your friends and family this Christmas. You've read so much about silly little things on your computer, you should say thank you to people in your life that allows you to play this game as well. I am personally writing this with the company of my family around, and I couldn't be happier.

I will be taking a good, restful break, and soon I'll be back in mid-January with the **first monthly newsmagazine.** If you're interested in getting your foot in the door, message me `@specificlanguage` on Discord (although you might not get an answer right away.)

For one final, weekly, time, thank you, and as always...

[***EDIT CIVWIKI***](https://civwiki.org), and thank you.
