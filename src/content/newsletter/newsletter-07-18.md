Good Monday Morning to everyone and welcome to the new website!

This website has been a long time coming despite its very simple appearance; but I've tried my best to copy over the best of the best that we've seen so far from HackMD to Reddit Newsletters to Civ newspapers, and I think this is a great medium ground between everything, so I'm pretty happy with how this turned out. All other previous posts have now been catalogued here, meaning you can go back through each of the different newsletters and find older news. Additionally, I've made some of the other things front and center, like the link to CivWiki and the Contribution form *(hint hint)*.

The site is currently set to whatever your system prefers, whether light or dark. To switch, just change your system setting; eventually a manual override toggle will come later if you prefer the look of the brighter website. Anything to get you awake this morning, I swear.

If you're a technical person and wondering how this was made, I've put some technical details on the [about page](https://civwiki.news/about). I'm continuing to make this site free and fair for *all*, you won't see any paywalls or subscriptions; maybe the occasional Patreon beg but nothing that blocks you from reading.

Thank you so much for getting the newsletter to the point where I can write about it regularly and have this much readership, I'm extremely grateful for all your support.

Ok, that's enough blabbering from me, here's the actual news this week:

## Features

### Featured Image

![](/old/samchester-new.png)

This week's featured image is the Samchester Citadel in Southshire, now officially built by RoboRik, LordofMarzipan, and JamesonIII. Southshire's plan was to bring together the defensive standards of older iterations like New Yoahtl City, but wanted to keep a particular aesthetic similar to old Southshire. This is what they've settled on today, a fortified city with a defensive structure, acting as a secure place for storage as well as a place for merchants to sell shops. Plots are still open today!

### Featured Article

![Alliances of Civcraft 2.0 throughout the server](/old/Civ2alliances.png)

The **[alliances of Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Alliances_of_Civcraft_2.0)** were major alliances spread across the second iteration of **[Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft)**, allied more geographically than ideologically. Alliances during this iteration were sparse and had little overlap compared to other alliances or non-aggression pacts in [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) or [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC). Many alliances took their namesake from the area countries resided in. Although many were largely military alliances they sometimes had internal free trade or infrastructure agreement with each nation. No alliances directly declared war on each other, but connections came into play in a number of military confrontations, including the [Yurtstead War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yurtstead_War) and the [Goten Secession Conflict](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Goten_Secession_Conflict).

Of the five alliances that survived at the end of Civcraft 2.0, the only alliance that can be clearly traced back to these origins are the [United Provinces of the Plus Plus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/United_Provinces_of_the_Plus_Plus) members that played in the [Volans](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Volans) shard in [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0), currently many play in the [Free Danzilonan Republic](https://civwki.org/wiki/Free_Danzilonan_Republic) or [Mery](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mery). Many alliances, like the Great Northern Alliance (GNA) were a large plurality of nations that maintain iterations in [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC) but no longer ally with each other.

## Current Events

![A render of Rhode Island City on CivMC](/old/rhodeisland.png)

*This section's header picture is a render of Rhode Island city by Maddog551.*

It's funny how some of the wars last week just resolved in, "let's just cut the shenanigans".

### Diplomacy is Better

- After last week's scuffles and tension between Rhode Island and Estalia, [the countries (shockingly) agreed to a non-aggression pact between the two countries.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vym2va/nonaggression_treaty_of_rhode_island_and_estalia/) Although this banned all problematic parties from each other's borders, they have agreed to peace until December of this year.
- [The Elysian Pact was created](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vzvvv2/formation_of_the_elysian_pact/) between Pavia, Estalia, Jorvik and SPQR, committing to regional security and infrastructure agreements between all countries.
- A recently held election for Yoahtl's first council resulted in six winners: Solitaire7, MechanicalRift, KingoftheMochas, iOminious, Scouter9001, and Klari.
- [PCRato becomes the Prime Minister of Lusitania](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vzovce/the_lambat_post_smelly_caught_two_nations_sign/) after a long, "hard-fought" election against me. I'll get you next time!
- Lusitania [signs a Mutual Recognition Treaty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vwoi5q/lusitaniarozia_mutual_recognition_treaty/) with nearby Rozia, and [another with Reconstruction Era.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/w1ji9r/reconstruction_era_has_signed_a_declaration_of/)
- Kallos reannounces their ["unexpected" return](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vxtsbc/mobilization_of_kallos/), hoping to rebuild and make more things out of obsidian

### Conflicts Happen Anyway

- A series of raidings by Vah hit many cities, including Mount Augusta, Valyria, and [most recently Icenia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/w0uqqy/nice_holiday_trip_with_the_boys_to_icenia_would/) and Dalgon, among others.
- [Titan Industries posted their own perspective](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vwz4zd/hostile_intentions_87_a_comprehensive_summary_of/) of [last week's conflict between Titan and KOEL](https://civwiki.org/wiki/KOEL-Titan_Conflict), with their justification including continued harassment of members of the company, notably Bloof. Although they pursued an attack of KOEL citizens, both countries sued for peace.
- RaccooonOnCrack and tvrreto [raided Venne's storage and factories](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/w07e79/wanted_raccoononcrack_and_tvrreto_for_raiding/), the former was [caught hours later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/w0airb/ladies_and_gentleman_we_got_him/)
- Saren & other Utopians fought Rhode Islanders for leaking information, which didn't result to much [except another Saren PvP video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vyaelp/utopia_vs_rhode_island/)
- Former Corvus player samnrad had been banned on CivMC for more than a month due to [duping on a prior server](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/f0nxgn/id_consider_the_corvus_people_highly_trustable/), he [publicly called on the admins to unban him](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vxj9np/ive_been_banned_for_5_weeks_can_i_get_a_response/), citing unreasonableness and unfairness. [Infra responded, backing up their moderation decisions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vxj9np/ive_been_banned_for_5_weeks_can_i_get_a_response/ifwzozk/)
- [SpeedyJustice was pearled after griefing a judge's property](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/w1k175/sauls_cry_for_justice_speedyjustice/); a trial is currently underway in Mount Augusta.
- Apparently Danzilona kept [getting raided with aSmellyBird pearling someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vx62n2/danzilona_invaded_once_again_asmellybird_broke/) then [getting pearled](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vx85qh/asmellybird_pearled_post_claims/), then having [somebody chopping their trees](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vzmcn2/wanted_the_sicko_who_has_been_cutting_down_some/). Oh yeah not to [mention also getting raided by BobTheBuilder & co.](https://discord.com/channels/948288144384589865/948291993384132638/998390372478750811) from earlier, what the hell give them a break
