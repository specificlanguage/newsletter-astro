Good morning and happy Monday from the Pacific Northwest!

It's quite a busy time for me but I think it's finally refreshing to start looking at Civ this weekend. No seriously, I think this has been the least stressful time it's been for the genre. Have you noticed this long peace has been for a year now? That feels like it's a record in Civ terms (although, maybe it's because we've just been fatigued with frequent/long wars).

As a reminder, this is the **third to last** edition of the weekly newsletters, savor it while you can! Are we ready to get to the news?

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is in Altepetl, a grand overview of the city. I was lucky when Simpology was around when I was here -- otherwise you most likely you would probably see one of the same views of the Pigeon in Town Square. I was able to tour some great spots around the city (some of which are very publicly accessible!) and I'm so happy to see. Really love how the city has progressed but retained its jungle style. Can't wait to come back once again!

### Featured Article

![](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/b/be/DUMP2.png)

**[DUMP](https://civwiki.org/wiki/DUMP)**, full name the 'Defense Union for Mutual Prosperity', was an alliance on CivClassic that intended to bring together the server's newer nations in an effort to join together under a defense and trade pact. Envisioned by new nation [Eddie Murphy](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy), its initial members primarily consisted of it and [Cortesia Del Mar](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Cortesia_Del_Mar), with several nations also appearing in its ranks throughout the months. Several nations were set to join the alliance however either backed out at the last second, or quit soon after their joining.

The alliance faced multiple issues throughout its history, including the [One Hour War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/One_Hour_War), the [Collapse of Eddie Murphy](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Collapse_of_Eddie_Murphy), and the [Columbia-Cascadia War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Columbia-Cascadia_War) throughout 2021. With the alliance in May 2021 consisting of [Blackwell](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Blackwell), [Monterey](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Monterey), and Cortesia Del Mar, the alliance would eventually dissolve and become the [Confederation of Eastern States](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CES) in May 2021. DUMP was one of the first examples of newfriend nations creating an alliance by themselves, something that would later be repeated with [Newfriend Development Initiative](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Newfriend_Development_Initiative) later on the server and the [International League of Assistance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/International_League_of_Assistance), although all have had varying levels of success.

*This week's featured image was the DUMP's flag.*

### This Week In Civ

<ColoredBlock color="bg-red-200" darkColor="dark:bg-red-950">

  On the week of December 9 - December 15 in:

  [2022](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-12-12/):

  - Negotiations between Gensokyo and Dalgon broke down as the allies of both countries could not agree on adequate reparations following the [Speedy Coup](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Speedy_Coup).
  - Icenia, Ocala, Temporal Isles, and Arnen became involved in a weekend of attacks and raids, resulting in Ocala being dissolved.
  - mTfUJi has created two different slander memes, one of which covers almost every aspect of CivMC.
  CivReign's latest teaser hints at Soul Steel, a metal stronger than Netherite.
  CivMC admins have encouraged nations to build Christmas trees or other objects to celebrate the holiday season, with a Christmas card contest and presents also being offered later down the line.

  [2023](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-12-11-2023):

  - Icenia and Yoahtl declared war on Gang Shi following revelations that the country was surreptitiously attempting to conquest the server, starting with Icenia; Yoahtl was implicated after the false pretenses of a non-aggression pact.
  - The Gang Shi vault, Black Mesa, was disabled by the two countries, known as the Dawn Guard Pact; later that weekend a Gang Shi-supported skybridge approached Altepetl but was unsuccessful; several players were pearled during this attack.
  - Baile pearled Renji_Haikon and Augustus_Vex, their own citizens following an internal dispute.
  - The Monument Group handed out dividends that were higher than expected due to high profits, it may intend to buy back shares to access a wider market in the future.
  - CivCubed introduced a vulnerability system that only allowed attacks during a certain timeframe; reception has been mixed but intended to increase activity on the server.

## The News

### CivMC Update

CivMC pushed out a quality of life update, ostensibly [their final update prior to the Christmas season](https://i.imgur.com/lbCXscI.png).

- SimpleVoiceChat was the highlight of the update, allowing players to talk to players nearby, around 100 blocks.
  - In general, [proximity voice chat has been a great boon to other games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djS3WrTcQNM), so it's very nice to see this on Civ. Can't wait for a vault break with this, lmao
- Essence is now collected in pouches to prevent clogging up inventory and can be withdrawn.
- Some buffs to both meteoric iron and heliodor pickaxes, the latter of which can now find roughly how many veins exist worldwide
- Pearls show their health rather than a percentage!
- Some updates to limit mob render distance and caps for lag reasons

### Around the Server

For most people unknown to Civ, the pattern I've been recently seeing is that most Metagame posts get thrown onto the subreddit, while the real news gets thrown into Discord.

- Highroll [was released from Kallos after he completed his mutually agreed upon reparations package.](https://i.imgur.com/p5cqxLd.png)
  - He was [previously pearled back in May, after a dispute with DockerImage.](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-05-20-2024/#around-the-server)
- Soderrike [dismissed Wormseed from his Senate position in the IF, citing "conspiracy" and "being a poor Senator".](https://i.imgur.com/VUWE41i.png) (cr. posted from the Diamond Chronicler)
  - No evidence for these reasons has been given, and derkaiser is being mysterious about his reasons for doing so, as well as [deleting its constitution and becoming its own absolute monarchy](https://i.imgur.com/2tV54si.png) (which, I believe is incompatible with IF law?)
  - Softkitten, another Soderrike senator, [also resigned from his Senate Seat in protest.](https://i.imgur.com/j22CfG2.png)
- Salerno [announced that Marstria would be joining their kingdom](https://i.imgur.com/J9RPSBl.png), along with some general announcements.
  - The country is [also passing the Royal Elections Act](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLg18KEAyVHklzb5VtiASOXMFqH2VQ0iyy2ZCPYZspo/edit?tab=t.0), introducing voting restrictions in the country.
- [Hakr_ announced his retirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h64cja/retirement_announcement/) from restart announcing duties. I guess he'll never take up my offer on `wheniscivmcrestarting.com`
- Yoahtl announced the results of November 2024's interim election, [with NeoTide claiming the seat after a close race with VilyanZ](https://i.imgur.com/W0Exdmx.png)
- Meanwhile, Volterra announced [that Election Reform also passed within their country](https://i.imgur.com/rICBY5c.png), (although I can't view the announcement!)
- More election stuff happening in [Lambat, with BloxerBoi being elected as the new mayor of Lambat City](https://i.imgur.com/YkCUIOy.png)
- Since we keep talking about election stuff, [Icenia announced voter registration form, requiring all voters to pay 20 essence to the government in order to vote](https://i.imgur.com/NWa2a1E.png).
- Icenia [did some demolishing in their city this past week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h709gx/breaking_goon_squads_destroying_ugly_and/), tearing down some old houses
- Truidencia [announced that the Imperial Regent would be able to act as the country's Emperor in all official matters](https://i.imgur.com/do9Xi0q.png), with Ambrosios being the current holder of the title.
- Estalia [is teasing a new Gmall update for the future.](https://i.imgur.com/Lt8Ez59.png)
- While technically a "joke", [the HKI were trying to build a rail when they got blocked by Estalia. So uh, yeah](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h7d5up/estalia_is_evil/)

### Economic & Meta-News

I'm separating this out simply for some complex things that aren't necessarily political happenings.

- There are likewise a few news-related organizations popping up (likely related to my timely departure...)
  - [The Karydian Times rebranded to the Diamond Chronicler](https://i.imgur.com/lWsZ3S4.png), as "the newspaper['s reach] has grown far beyond what I expected."
  - They [are also looking for Pavians, asking about the sentiment of the state for an upcoming article.](https://forms.gle/KtWv8jWEBBSfou1q7)
  - The [Bedford Herald announced its first edition](https://i.imgur.com/ZzZ83eB.png) ([reddit link here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h6fbx7/the_bedford_herald_1222024/)), including a lottery for those who solve the crossword!
- Pavia [announced a CUB agreement with Khalkedonia to promote economic and friendship ties between the two nations.](https://i.imgur.com/WepI1e3.png)
- Meanwhile, [Monument Group opened up a new branch in Eldoria, expanding connections between the two nations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivPavia/comments/1h6etj2/monument_group_expands_operations_in_eldoria_two/)
- [Tusk Armory also released its November Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11u60qDseZ9ttbut5x6mGQtRPfob2RjG5/view?usp=sharing), where despite a small closure the company has hit record numbers in revenue, profits, market cap, and more!


### Metagame Highlights

- Christopher Chrispie created [a long post protesting the increase in pearl costs](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h5xjor/bgbbas_soul_has_entered_my_body_raising_pearl/)
  - The short version is that he thinks raising costs are stupid, and this is not the way to "break the cycle of perpetual conflict".
  - Keep in mind that **pearl costs have and did not increase (yet)**, not to mention these costs will rise slowly anyway. I did not find the actual source because the discord search function is garbage
  - While definitely a good argument in theory to [keep out the intentional server killers...](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h5xjor/bgbbas_soul_has_entered_my_body_raising_pearl/m0adka0/)
  - What has not been stated is [his own thoughts on how to break that cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h5xjor/bgbbas_soul_has_entered_my_body_raising_pearl/m09ejg7/?context=10000/), so great post bro
  - Anyway there's [just a lot of people blabbering in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h5xjor/bgbbas_soul_has_entered_my_body_raising_pearl/m09vavw/?context=10000) so I think I'm going to move on and not waste my time. Definitely worth a longer discussion, but that's for the poll
- ChrisChrispie [has also realized the importance of updating the CivWiki](https://i.imgur.com/AOObv2c.png)
- [Finding the biggest events in CivMC is hard when you're not around for 2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h4q3p9/what_would_you_guys_consider_the_most_important/), although can we please stop calling it Butt sex war, god
- Some general history questions about [Devoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h84neo/what_happened_to_civdevoted_30/) and [CivClassic](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h8vkmj/why_were_civclassics_wars_so_long/) -- the reason why you'll see them later will be evident shortly
- Tophat [talks about the "kinds" of newfriends he's faced](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h9h464/the_types_of_newfriends/) -- although I don't think it covers everything
- [Vault Science is back with a multi-part series on Bastion Vaults](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h9oe05/vault_science_a_history_of_bastion_vaults_part_i/)

Here we go, time to clear up the two week plus backlog!

- [Pavia finished their Wisteria Theater, a fully functioning theatre with a grand hall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h750x0/wisteria_theatre_the_latest_addition_to_the_city/) It looks incredible (and the only reason I didn't feature it is that I've been featuring too many Pavia builds lately!) (cr: Gobblin & co.)
- [Yoahtl's train station looking like the TVA over here](https://i.imgur.com/MI2J3pP.jpeg) (it's very good) (cr: x1025)
- [What a piece of junk! (non-derogatory)](https://i.imgur.com/tiuAWYL.png) (cr: Byhalia)
- [It's weird how Shockton looks at the North Pole](https://i.imgur.com/Q0R0WeT.png) even though it's clearly in the Jungle (cr: Seldomsh0ck)
- [I was also going to show off this architecturally interesting farmhouse in Groveheart](https://i.imgur.com/xOVlDTu.png) but I also have been featuring them way too much too (cr: Gidein)
- The Interior Designers will finally be happy [when I post this dining room from Shockton](https://i.imgur.com/RjBp8yA.png) (cr: Seldomsh0ck)
- I've already mentioned [Soria Castle covered in snow but the spires are very distinct](https://i.imgur.com/cKOTTDQ.png) and look good (cr: VilyanZ)
- [Yeah foggy snow covered things look good with Kaiserburg](https://i.imgur.com/iIImfOE.png) (cr: bananablu)
- A very nature covered house [in Pavia's Bedford, a place not really known for great builds](https://i.imgur.com/Rx4f6Q2.png). Amazing work! (cr: Brasst)
- [Griffin in a large render distance slaps](https://i.imgur.com/YOdw00B.png) (cr: BritishWanderer)
- [Oh uh yeah, Pavia too](https://i.imgur.com/4BPk6J9.png) (cr: BritishWanderer)
- Giant arc bridges are rare on Civ [so this one in Bloom looks very good (and architecturally sound)](https://i.imgur.com/kJKusI5.png) (cr: querevs)
- Although even smaller bridges still have their own charm, [including this one as part of the Interstate network in the Imperial Federation](https://i.imgur.com/nxS0GD8.png) (cr: mattbruhr)

Actually, I didn't even clear the backlog at all with this. Well.....

### Cool Content

- Alright, [it's *finally* about time someone really created a full genre overview and it's really good](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h9d0aq/this_is_part_zero_on_a_series_i_want_to_do_on_the/). If I had to make notes it would be minor things (like the 6-month gap being quite literally just pent-up hype for CivMC) (cr: Pandastical)
- [Pavia has been tracking general election and polling counts for quite some time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h6ajvm/pavia_early_december_ourgov_polling_voting/), so it's nice to see that finally come to life on the main wiki. (cr: Cissonius)
- [A great high-level timeline of the server so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h6d1pk/i_made_a_little_civmc_timeline_out_of_fun_3_thank/), although I wouldn't personally add the Purple War. Regardless it's at least a great visualization, and also a great indication of the current long peace period. (cr: Pandastical)
- [Bedford is starting their own newspaper (and it looks actually very good)!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h6fbx7/the_bedford_herald_1222024/) Let's hope it lasts more than 3 editions! (cr: Steelhand7)
- This [reinforcement tutorial counts as cool content because good editing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h81x70/newfriends_theres_always_ctf_please_use_it/), best /ctf tutorial in the darn tootin west (cr: Tophat)
- I guess this counts. Vintage [Civ meme from the Butternut-SEC War](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h5e52r/found_this_picture_in_my_files_when_cleaning_my/) styled in the fashion of an album cover.
- I've completely missed talking about the CivBall map of the world -- *I guess it's cause I haven't seen the Map part yet*. But the Civball part is looking quite good. Fun new highlights include:
  - The [Hello Kitty Isles](https://i.imgur.com/3vCoteg.png) (cr: natls)
  - [Volterra](https://i.imgur.com/wkiwbsM.png) (cr: cokebrothers)
  - E-Girl [Southshire](https://i.imgur.com/GTm7VZJ.png) (cr: Eddie)
  - [Salerno](https://i.imgur.com/qe3gX4w.png) (cr: ksven)
  - a very dopey [Great Western Bay](https://i.imgur.com/UfqMlon.png) (cr: Vulcan1776)
  - [Bebo Inc](https://i.imgur.com/DkccuZH.png), and fun [MtA balls](https://i.imgur.com/NeWDCKx.png) (cr: itslara13)
  - A [royal Amiticia](https://i.imgur.com/wgi79UL.png)
  - [Fempire](https://i.imgur.com/4jsrBqI.png) (cr: socialistspectre)
  - I could go on with very good quality balls but I'm going to stop there so the Map of the World will actually showcase them all

### Memes

- [camel](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h695cg/limosuine)
- Well, [here's another Hitler dubbing scene about the IF](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h8b45t/downfall_a_typical_day_in_karydia/). Don't get me wrong, it's good, but have we seen one before?
- [Khalkedonia becomes the Boys](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1h8u3cy/khalkedonia_gov_inspired_by_the_boys_movie_poster/)
- We [need to ban the olympics so this doesn't happen again](https://i.imgur.com/Zv5QDWf.png)

### Non-Civ Content

- Me and, funnily enough a lot of the Admins and prolific Civ coders, [have been grinding out Advent of Code for the last few days (as of Dec 8)!](https://i.imgur.com/xpALUpW.png)
  - Now, just to note that I'm only top right now because I live in a really good time zone for this. I am probably going to fall off in about 10 days.
- Music corner:
  - [...skeet skeet god damn (christmas accent)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SVPH9pSJUY)
  - [TwoSet Violin returns with a banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jExn6TXxenM), although i wish their old videos were still up :(
  - [I'm very glad BDG is making music again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL4CIRygoH0)
  - You will [absolutely revolt at my spotify wrapped, by the way](https://i.imgur.com/w7LhV8k.png). Nearly half of the things I listen to are from work, and the other half are not on Spotify at all.
- Baseball offseason [just got crazy with Juan Soto getting a giant contract](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1ha09ed/heyman_breaking_juan_soto_to_the_mets_765m_15/) with the METS BABY LET'S GO METS LOVE THE METS
- I would have more, but honestly I've just been so busy that I haven't had time to really explore music here.

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/D5Ao4lV.png)

*Shockton, all full of snow. It looks like a Christmas Village from this point of view! (cr: Seldomsh0ck)*

Last week, we had **63 responses,** which is surprisingly, more than usual.

### How Long Does CivMC Have Left?

For those newer to the genre (or haven't played in a while), nearly every long-running Civ server has gotten longer and longer; the current record holder is actually CivMC's predecessor, CivClassic at 4.5 years, whose stability had even been in question at CivMC's point in its life.

Meanwhile, CivMC, in Civ server standards has been really stable and actually very passable in Minecraft standards. How long though, is a very interesting question, which this really hinges upon.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7qi8LtF.png)

> i think [the server] will last at least two years longer considering the large playerbase and how beloved the map is

Two years seems to be the prevailing answer, which at this point would *tie* CivClassic in terms of timeline.

Interestingly, I think this is the point in Civ history where we actually don't reset because of an external factor (which is sort of the reason for most long-running server deaths), but because the playerbase will be fatigued from playing this *map* too long. I love it, but sometimes, you just want something new to play to forge new relationships.

> I think there needs to be a good balance between a server that lasts long enough for people to be willing to build up the type of orgs and infrastructure that we've all come to know in the genre. Yet, having a server last in perpetuity also hinders the growth of the community. I think it would be good for the admins to reset the server every few years.

While the admins are doing a great job adding novelty in an otherwise "solved" game, there's definitely some people who just want a fresh slate to start something new again -- which is a difficult problem for someone coming into the genre for the first time. Not to mention the large effort to produce marketing hype, a new map, interesting mechanics to hook players, etc.

Now, this isn't to say, the admins need to reset the map. But it's worth a thought experiment.

### Alliance Types

![](https://i.imgur.com/OhjATfe.png)

This iteration has seen a much different alliance system than other Civ servers we've seen so far. A lot more nations have taken upon the model popularized by The Commonwealth, having multiple nations under a single unifying country to control their international policy. We've seen that more lately with Icenia, the IF, and Yoahtl, and it's seen much more success this time around, although it generally works better with a central authority, which is a little bit less in the IF, which as a result brings us to:

> Confederations seem to produce the most vibrant, dynamic, and idverse cultral and political environments, and while those don't necessarily have the same staying power and self-contained communities, those environments of confluence and exchange are some of the most innovative and striking featrures of the genre.

While I'm never the one to compare Civ people to channers, Lyrean Community has some sort of comparison to pan-Chan alliances in Civcraft 2.0. It's still sort of allowed this autonomy internally and so far has been a great boon to the small, tight-knit community for the protectorates included. Long-term, I am curious to see if another national force can also pull this off.

> Multinational alliances are hard to get right but will work well under the right management. The people who want to power play and control large alliances are the last people who should be running them.

When I usually think of multi-national alliances, I think of things like Entente or NATO that span the whole map and become military powerhouses, which doesn't feel good for the community. But of course, there are the more wholesome ones, but for a historical Civ player this is what it gravitates to sometimes. It does feel exhausting to micromanage a whole nation for a newfriend though.

## Wintery Wonderland Cry for Help

![](https://i.redd.it/jkzozcu7ey4e1.jpg)

*Several Icenians coming together to tear down some derelict houses in the city (cr: ChrisChrispie)*

Wow, I actually didn't have to run my garbage newsletter meta-ads this week -- [how do I tell people what I want so I can make money now??](https://i.imgur.com/PdZscw3.png)

Thank you for reading this week's newsletter, and I did this one all by myself -- no real clarifying questions necessary here. A little bit exhausting and took a little bit more time than I used to (although maybe it's just cause I'm washed).

As we're going to be switching the format soon (I'll talk about it more next week!), I'm looking for **regular columnists** to help with the newsletter -- it's only a *monthly* commitment, and you'd be able to write about anything, as long as it's related to Civ. Reach out to me if you're interested, `@specificlanguage` on Discord!

Thanks so much for all your support. Until next week...
