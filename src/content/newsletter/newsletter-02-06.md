Good morning and happy Monday from freezing New England!

This past weekend it was quite below freezing where I am, with a biting low temperature of -3F/-20C with a howling 20+mph windchill so it's nice to sit back, relax and make a newsletter. It wasn't actually that nice though. Honestly, it's biting cold out there, so bundle up and stay safe this winter!

I'm sure there was already good incentive to stay inside instead of freezing outside, because things are already quite heating up in game!

Ready for the news?

This week's featured image is a gate along Griffin's road network; they've built out a large road network stretching from Amboise and Adria down to Pavia. There are several landmarks like these along the road network built to this level of perfection, it's really nice and very evocative of the rest of their build style. I always love seeing niche infrastructure projects like this and I'm looking forward to more across the server!

![](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/e/ec/OrionCapital.png)

[**Orion**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Orion) was a country on [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0) focused on a democratic and capitalist system of government, with striking similarities to the United States government. The country was established at the start of the world in the middle of the northwest quadrant, and quickly became known as the most populous country on the server. Due to its easy access and low barriers to entry (which included a free plot for [newfriends](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Jargon#Newfriend)), the country saw several conflicts throughout its lifespan, including the [raids from the Bloodcrew](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1rdpif/orion_is_now_safe_from_the_bloodcrew/), [Cuban Revolution](https://imgur.com/a/TgBHs#Ik73Ffq), an [secession crisis from Sennisten](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/2942c1/senntisten_declares_independence_from_orion/), one of the country's borough.

Although the country had an anarchic build system, the country had several areas of cultural significance. The country had several notable builds, including the capitol (pictured), a grand train station connecting the [CIC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CIC), and the Grand Olympic Stadium, playing host to the first known Olympics held on Civ servers, and [inspiring future Olympics on CivClassic.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Olympics) Additionally, Cuban leader Farley50 lent his name to today's [Farley War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Farley_war), a term known for either a roleplay war between two parties or an event where players use weaker materials for fighting. Today, some of Orion's players [make up today's Jorvik.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Jorvik) ([**Full article**...](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Orion))

*This week's featured picture is the Orion capitol, in its capital. Finally, the Featured Articles list no longer a list that Farley50 is not on.*

### Estalia Drama

- Estalia embarked on a "Gong Night" this past weekend, [a reference to when they (at the time, jokingly) removed the Gong at the Gensokyo Shrine/Train Station](/newsletter-12-19#alenarith--southeast) a couple months ago.
    - Headlining that night was removing Gensokyo gongs a second time, [as retaliation for Gensokyo lying and stealing several stacks of build materials during their 0,0 builds.](https://discord.com/channels/984384844236718090/984385864740265994/1071889630544285847)
    - [Red_Steel was also attacked by Estalians last night in Danzilona](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10u1lev/estalia_what_the_fuck_and_why/), and was banned from the Estalia discord after being told to turn themselves in for a reduced sentence.
        - Estalians also griefed several areas in Danzilona, and said [that Red_Steel had been "harassing" Shapha](https://discord.com/channels/984384844236718090/984385864740265994/1071815285297913948), and requested she to be pearled for two weeks.
        - Danzilona is currently in negotiations with Estalia for appropriate sentencing, [with several territories & players expressing distaste for the attacks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10uuj3k/church_of_ranubis_official_calls_on_estalia_to/)
    - [Yodabird was also attacked in Nara by thejkh](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10u1lev/estalia_what_the_fuck_and_why/j79uwrb/) earlier that night. Estalia clarified that "Yodabird was not meant to be attacked", and was only attacked after those in VC joked about his Interpol neutral colors. Estalian leader S4NTA expressed apologies to Yodabird.
- Meanwhile, Lysika_Lantariel [posted an "Active Nations" map that hoped to accurately portray which nations are active and see the amount of land being deprived by newfriends](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/)
    - However, no one person actually knows the full extent of all players, [so it's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j78mwu5/) [really funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j78t9ij/) [looking at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j792x8t/) [the other](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j78ld0z/) ["active" nations](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j78t78b/) [malding and coping](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10tsxb1/active_claims_map_draft_see_comment/j78xvwx/)

### Pettier Drama (Yes, There's More)

Please note some links in below block are NSFW. I know a lot of you readers read this on your phone on the way to work or whatever, so just keep an eye out.

- Cordoba accused Gang Shi members Gwua and UB40 for [continued aggression against Cordoba for the past two months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10u89d4/denunciation_of_the_gangshi_kallos_juniortide_and/)
    - Although not reported in the news for the past month\*, the country has been hit with raids from Gang Shi and Kallos since December, [from raids on their vault](https://imgur.com/rTNPNRQ) to [raiding Cordoban farms](https://imgur.com/KYRaSXh)
    - Tensions came to a head after Cordobans discovered attempts to place TNT to kill Cordobans as well [as removing all the Cordoban horses.](https://imgur.com/RaSlmRn) In the ensuing fighting, Gwua was killed, and in response, much of Gang Shi came down and [pearled](https://imgur.com/V4PkJzJ) [four](https://imgur.com/xUOhiMU) [Cordoban](https://imgur.com/j0ElAj9) [citizens](https://imgur.com/0oA8Qat).
- Despite attempted peace talks, engagement continued [with a Cordoban pearled Sunday evening.](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1071984957460848762)
    - This came as a result of a few Cordobans griefing their nether portal, with Gang Shi fighters pearling two and killing one.
    - This quickly [grew into a large engagement from Cordoban defense forces fighting SEC and Gang Shi affiliated attackers](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1071986293506068560).
    - Part of the reason was that Chosentwicelol, a wanted criminal in Icenia, was present during the attacks and was seen aiding Cordoba, which prompted SEC support.
- Late that evening (are you serious, Sunday night?!) [Gang Shi posted their response to the above situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10ux2zz/the_situation_in_cordoba_a_gang_shi_perspective/):
    - While they had been meming in prior engagements before this weekends' drama, the country's eventual perspective was that Cordoba was negotiating in bad faith -- Gang Shi claimed had been the ones to approach for peace talks.
    - They cited several incidents that [Cordoba attacked after promising peace attacks on Friday](https://imgur.com/pVSYnIM).
    - Finally, they claim that the country has been insensitive, bringing up the group's history as well as the country's recent actions being seen as mockery instead of memery. They also note [their previous engagement with Blockchainistan](/newsletter-09-26#other-drama), a similarly insensitive and inappropriate country on Civ.

Motivations on both sides are quite murky, with Cordobans playing the innocent card [while demanding reparations for the attacks in poor faith](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10ux2zz/the_situation_in_cordoba_a_gang_shi_perspective), and Gang Shi [accusing the country *(NSFW)*](https://imgur.com/AHO9snv) [of being terrible people and insensitive. *(NSFW)*](https://i.imgur.com/HumMt8B.png). However, there have been general sentiments, [especially among Alenarith citizens,](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/687531186117148706/1071919288706928640/IMG_7946.png) that Cordoba is not as savory as many people think.

*Whoops, there's no ads this week! Nobody contacted me for a slot. I guess everyone was too occupried with the war. Please contact me at @specificlanguage#2891 if you're looking to advertise in the newsletter.*

- [So this is another bullshit reputation thread but I can put my own newsletter on here, so that's cool I guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10ppiwx/reputation_thread_but_for_nationsorganizations/), I do find it funny that I personally cannot get upvotes but the newsletter does lmao
