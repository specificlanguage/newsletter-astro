Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

Not a long intro today for me because I just have to make this one this week so I don't fall too far behind unfortunately. Not even that long this week because we're lacking on content once again, but looking forward to this week and it's a busy one, I'm sure everyone is having a great time.

Let's get to the news...

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is of New Callisto, the new capital of the Imperial Federation. It may not look like much right now, but I love the style and rustic feel of both the train station and the factory building that it's a great start for a country that's still feeling its way around trying to rebuild. A great start for its (third?) capital of the country, looking forward to more.

Unfortunately, I actually don't have a featured article this week. It's not that I had any ideas left (although, I don't have any ideas right now), but I didn't give the HCF War, the featured article last week, its right due on the front page the previous week, so it's going to get shown on the front page within in the day.

### Metagame Highlights

- Discord screenshots will no longer be able to be accessed publicly outside of the app; if you have used discord as a file upload service in the past to store your pictures (**especially if you had a picture in this newsletter**), download your pictures and upload them to a new file service for safekeeping. Upload 'em to CivWiki for all I care, I don't.
- [SoundTech's weekly update signals that the team has been very busy outside of the game](https://i.imgur.com/X9DlOBu.png) (same here, buddy), but working on a revamp of Kira and monitoring tools like CivSpy. Additionally, Diet_Cola and Owain_X are intermittently working on Civ plugin upgrades to 1.20.

### Non-Civ Content

#### Sports Content

* The baseball season came down to the wire with only eight of the twelve playoff spots clinched coming into Saturday night -- [that is, until the Mariners lost Saturday](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-fall-to-rangers-wait-to-see-if-they-live-another-day/) and made it impossible for them to make it to the playoffs, fucking hell. [Looking forward to another "unexpected" Houston sweep in the World Series this season](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/434122846646829057/1158170071932338276/image.png?ex=651b456e&is=6519f3ee&hm=6251da9ba556dc502091f8790a3747a4e5d4c221b5d828ceabdd145397d8304b&), even if they literally don't deserve it
* The Denver Broncos won the toilet bowl of the season, coming back from a 28-7 deficit against the other worst team in the league, the Chicago Bears. Everyone saw that coming, right?

#### Things People Care About

* For those Japanese inclined, [here's a little trip back to a funk fusion band, Casiopea, which is so fucking good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKgjOCuW_MU) Did you know that [keyboardist Minoru Mukaiya is now composing for JR?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSG5IkRA9BE)
* I've also [discovered possibly the best (and simultaneously cursed) mashup album this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTDmhxJTdeA), please brace yourself for laughter.
* Swordmaster's birthday was September 30, please birthday react in Nara discord. No, I won't link it, go do it yourself.

### Poll of the Week

Last week we had... wait... 27 responses? What?

The problem last week was that I uploaded an initial version of the poll as a picture, with the *actual* poll right below that. I suppose a number of people got confused since I use the picture as an editing device since it doesn't show up on my preferred editor before it goes to publishing. It won't happen again in the future.

The first and only question, of which the data is pretty much not worth looking at, was **"Would you prefer to have less or more frequent updates?"

![](https://i.imgur.com/gpQdhNZ.png)

I think I can safely say that there are a good amount of people that do care about the updates being good and frequent, but it doesn't matter how often things get updated. Unfortunately, I asked this because the pace we've been going at so far has been very, very slow. That PvP update we have been asking for a while has not happened at all yet. So we'll have to see whether this will pan out in the future.

So what about the poll for this week? Well...

<ColoredBlock color="bg-sky-200" darkColor="dark:bg-sky-950">
    <Poll client:load submitURL={"/newsletter-09-25"} questions={
        [
            {
                questionID: "bottingtime",
                question: "Roughly how long per day do you leave your account inactive on the server? (Botting counts, anything where you're away from your keyboard)",
                options: [
                    "I don't bot",
                    "Less than 1 hour a day (Select this if you sometimes just forget your account is online)",
                    "About 1-4 hours a day",
                    "About half a day",
                    "All day",
                ],
                type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,
                useOther: false,
                required: false
            },
        ]
    }/>

## Sunday Night Cry for Help

I have a lot going on this week, so honestly, nothing much to say here besides thanks for reading, and...

Before you go, **[have a look at tybug's op-ed this week about reliable sources on Civ](https://hackmd.io/extras/reputable-sources/)**. It's well written and should help editors make CivWiki better! (This was here last week, but I assume most of you haven't seen it.)

- If you'd like to get your stuff in the newsletter ***like this op-ed today!!!***, either [Write a featured article](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9), or contact me to write an op-ed at `@specificlanguage` on Discord. My DMs are "open" for questions if you've got any for either request!

See you next week,
