Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

Even as heat, smoke, and storms are doing some crazy stuff to the weather, it's always nice to return inside to the possibly-existent air conditioning and play virtual block game on funny screen.

Meanwhile, there's a lot of coding with me this week that I don't quite want to discuss quite yet because I'm still working on it, although you'll see some of the fruits of that in the newsletter. For example, try scrolling down! If you're on Desktop, you'll see there's a new progress bar just below the headings for this week. Isn't that neat?

That's enough tech blabbering from me, are we ready for the news?

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is the town center in Port o'Mehri in (well, take a guess...) Mehri. As a quaint little village nestled in the countryside between Pavia and Lambat, it's a nice little break away from all of the cities we've been seeing the past few days. Many of these buildings have been relatively untouched since the start of the world, and I'm hoping it stays that way. The city as a whole looks very much like this and it all gives off this nature vibe that goes throughout the entire country. Can't wait to visit again!

*This week's featured article was written by prawny331.*

The **[Great War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_War_(CivRealms_2.0))** was a war in late 2020 on the server [CivRealms 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms_2.0) between the coalition ([Carbon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Carbon), [Northern Defensive Pact](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Northern_Defensive_Pact) and [Rhodesia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Rhodesia)) and the [USA](https://civwiki.org/wiki/USA), which was a coalition of former enemies (notably [Blackwater](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Blackwater), Olympia, [Chungus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Chungus) and later [Savaguard](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Savaguard)). The War started following the obbybombing of the trade city [CivCorp](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivCorp), and the following fallout developed into an all-out war between the bombers and their allies and much of the rest of the server. The conflict also spilled over into the [New World](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_World), with several bombers seeking to form a new state in the isolated shard, starting the [Barbary War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Barbary_War). The war saw several major [vaults](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Vault) fall, starting with the incomplete [Varathian](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varathia) and [Bloom](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Bloom) vaults, the [Napistan](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Napistan) vault Daybreak (in which Carbon's leader, [Convoy](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Convoy), was pearled) and eventually the [Yggdrasil](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yggdrasil) vault Asgard after a prolonged two week siege.

The fall of Asgard was devastating to the allies, losing many pearls and most of the pearls they'd obtained in the defence in the failed retreat to the megavault Heaven. The war directly led to the collapse in activity on the server, due to a large number of combatants being pearled as the war developed into a stalemate with only bots remaining active. During the war, admins also made controversial decisions, including banning [Citadel](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Citadel) bombing for a short period, creating a "King of the Ashes" rule, adding a small chance to instantly kill a player following the fall of Asgard, and banning of most of the USA. Following the war, the server's activity never recovered, with most players returning to [Civclassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) or joining [CivUniverse](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivUniverse). **[(Full article...)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_War_(CivRealms_2.0))**

A much quieter week this time around, but there's still some funny stuff to talk about to say the least.

### Happenings Around CivMC

- [SlothInASuit was pearled, by Gang Shi, for attempting to skybridge the Pavia vault.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14sh4ph/freethesloth/) [They are expected to have a court trial completed sometime in the future.](https://i.imgur.com/XtrcaNf.png)
  - Protests have been planned, however they have been received generally negatively by the community. I kind of find it impressive that the Civ community [has basically done a complete 180 on his reputation over the last couple of months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/13shet9/slothinasuit_appreciation_post/)
- Gang Shi also announced that [their reparations post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14p7ndb/butternut_sec_war_sentencing/) from last week [was accepted by Yoahtl](https://i.imgur.com/jEzPYj6.png), and hoped for continued peace with their neighbors.
- [Solitaire was pearled by Shapha in Pavia due to an argument, but was quickly released](https://i.imgur.com/ufK7L3A.png), it has been noted as an "isolated incident"
- [Pavia announced the death of Emperor BritishWanderer I](https://i.imgur.com/I5hcPF2.png) (or Crown Prince BritishWanderer IV, depending how you're counting) due to ailing health over the past week. He appointed ArtificialDriver I to be his successor.
- There is quite a large fight about [whether Alba or the Catholic Church had claims to a particular claim of land.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14qimeg/albas_claims_map/) Way more than I think is necessary, but this is the Catholic Church we're talking about...
- Speaking of the Catholic Church, [the Pope resigned with their new leader supposed to be elected on Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14t0xhs/va_pope_leo_i_to_resign_college_to_be_held_on/)
- Mount Augusta is [holding an election for pucker678's judge seat, which is shaping up to be the most competitive in months](https://i.imgur.com/NI2wM5l.png) -- and by "most competitive" I really mean this election is the first in a while to have more than two candidates. I wouldn't be surprised if pucker retains his seat.
- [CloneChris was elected Tribune of SPQR this past week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivSPQR/comments/14relgn/july_election_results/)
- Speaking of Chrises, Icenia is currently in the process of electing its new Senate; although reduced in size, [many veterans from the war are coming back to govern the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14vihl7/icenia_holds_first_postwar_election/)
- [Thoria is basically just claiming over the CCTT, I don't know how Plupsnup feels about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14qj61g/updated_claims_of_thoria/)
- [The Sunset Isles skip the night phase and turn into the Sunrise Isles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14sqsvs/the_sunrise_treaty_of_2023_sunset_isles_now/)
- [In Nara, Atlas Corp and the King Corporation are merging.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14ueaon/atlas_corp_and_king_corp_merger_agreement/) Ah yes, more corporate merging...
- Speaking of corporations, the [Monument Group announced they would close down their building and property design branch](https://i.imgur.com/vUgYaKD.png), after declines in revenue, increasing time commitments and unrelenting demand.
- [A bar crawl idea is probably the best Civ event idea I've heard in a while, bring your pubs into the mix here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14st7y1/civmc_bar_crawl/)

### Metagame Highlights

- [I'm at least glad that somebody is stepping up to compete against TheJmqn](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14q1nkp/requesting_claims_reference_links_for_map_project/), maybe we'll start seeing some [Paper Towns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgDGlcxYrhQ)?
- [Plupsnup created r/CivVexillology](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14tpz3k/what_is_rcivvexillology_what_are_its_rules/), which I'm surprised hasn't existed yet. [There are already quite a few flags being shown off](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivVexillology/new)
- [Mickale wrote a post about his own philosophy about pearling](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14pxmqj/philosophy_of_pearling/), and has garnered a good amount of subreddit PvP
- Lysika is [still trying to develop his active nations map](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14uw237/updated_active_nations_claims_map_wip_see_comments/), while TheJmqn [released his own claims map](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14vdl1u/civmc_unofficial_map_18_the_world_of_tomorrow_for/)

### Admin Announcements & Server Statements

- CivMC admin RedDevel [released a form asking players to submit brews for future consideration and release](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14pgljy/submit_your_brews/). It's happening!!
- On July 3, SoundTech [announced a new exponential cost increase for holding pearls on CivMC](https://i.imgur.com/RJZ7Bws.png), with a new requirement of nearly seven (but later, four) players required to keep a player perma. Players had been clamoring for this for a while, as it's currently possible to keep three pearls with only one player right now. [There has been a lot of debate over this that is somewhat unhelpful on the discord.](https://i.imgur.com/VbdP59q.png)
- If you haven't heard much news from Return of the Civ, it's basically inactive now as neither admin has been putting in updates and there hasn't been any activity on the server as of late.

- [Soundtech is visiting Vermont](https://i.imgur.com/0r9Bc45.png), and not the Imperial Federation nation.

### Poll of the Week

We saw a cumulative 93 votes this week. I knew that doing the polls inline was a much better idea than before.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TdOz3Ve.png)

I always find it very interesting to see the spread of players throughout the server and how everyone comes from different backgrounds. Of course, we know the entire server is dominated by the East Coasters and Western Europeans, but there's always that Australian and Eastern Europe population out there that seems to be always ever present. Although we're only seeing a marginal amount of people from South America and Asia, I always find it odd that there are very few people from Civ who play on the West Coast. Maybe they're all just out partying.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1f1emCG.png)

I think it's safe to say that I will never be linking to a discord message again in my entire life.

**We'll give the poll a break this week.** Not because I couldn't think of a question or anything, but because I think we're all polled out. But totally not because I couldn't think of a question to ask everyone....
