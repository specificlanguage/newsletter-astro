Good morning and happy Monday from New England! Another great week in Civ has gone and come by, and I hope everyone is doing well. We're about a month removed from the war, and the server seems to be feeling much more healthy than it was. Even though I haven't been playing as much, I can at least feel that everyone is definitely less worried than before.

This week, I visited the Pavian Four Continent Concordat signing ceremony and conferred with the (still) planned train station in Mt. Augusta, so maybe that will get done Soon^TM? Anyway, let's just go ahead and get to the news:

This week's featured image is of Santiago, Cortesia del Mar's capital. Pictured in the middle is the Fish Lady statue; its respective park, Peachtree Plaza has been used for the Cortesian handoff of power ceremony, as well as the presidential debate for the country's now-completed election, more on that soon! This plaza is just the beginning of the urban expansion eastward, with MrsDoomBringer hoping to expand the city with the buildings around the Plaza.

The **[Maester Alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Maester_Alliance)** is a group of players preserving the stories, texts and accounts that have been written by other Civ players into in-game books. Players can be nominated to the alliance as Maesters by transcribing highly requested works, with 37 players being initiated as Maesters to this day. Most books transcribed by the Maesters have been from past iterations onto the current ones, using their own mod, [Ghostwriter](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mods#Bookkeeping), to aid them in transcription, however other real-life works have been written in game.

The Maesters have been present on nearly every major Civ server, originating on [Civcraft 1.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_1.0) all the way up to modern-day Civ servers like [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) and [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC). Each Civ iteration brings a new library design and headquarters, ranging from humble mining outposts to large grand central libraries and towers. Their intricate libraries, notably [Shardore Tower Library](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Shardore_Tower_Library), are set up with easily accessible book lists and a unique book classification system, allowing readers to borrow books easily. Today, Maesters have set up two headquarters in [Yoahtl](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yoahtl) and [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivMC)).

*North Africa in the Commonwealth, a home to many international organizations and becoming a burgeoning borough in the country.*

- Mount Augusta [elected a new mayor this week.](https://discord.com/channels/948288144384589865/948291993384132638/1031224049159917572)
    - ComradeNick was unable to run again due to term limits, which left Judges Asakuun and wFangw to run for the position.
    - The latter fell into some controversy after SpeedyJustice [put out a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feP5Eo3XjbE) with recorded conversations in Mount Augusta; many saw this as a violation of privacy [as no consent for the recordings was given.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y32m6c/if_you_read_any_civ_reddit_post_this_week_im/is6m4pn/)
    - Nevertheless, after a relatively close election, Mount Augusta elected wFang as mayor this past weekend.
    - His initial cabinet saw DrKnees as Lieutenant Governor, TheNeonNerd as Cup of City Beautification, and ComradeNick returning as Cup of Defense
    - A judge election has triggered as a result of wFang's vacancy, with SpacemanSpleef running with other candidates running to "provide an illusion of competition."
- Truidencia [was obbybombed and griefed this week](https://imgur.com/a/6iwtn6F) by AlexanderTheBest and Olivay this past week.
    - Eventually, [Estalians pearled the AlexanderTheBest this week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y35mo7/alexanderthebest_pearled_post_claims/)
- A very confusing sequence of events this past week came with Lonnik as it was just terraforming flat land, when all of a sudden, [Lonnik was dissolved by Slusshi](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y4d445/the_dissolution_of_lonnik/), but unilaterally??
    - The rationale was that it was a one man nation with a claim size rivaling Pavia, and was pearled by him, so he could not reasonably contest claims.
    - It's had mixed support, some are happy to see crayon-claiming one-man nations on the map, others are ambivalent.
    - [The UAK quickly claimed over the south portion of the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y4tral/the_u%C3%A4k_claims_southern_lonnik/)
- The [Four Continent Concordat](https://discord.gg/vWfxm3AU), or FCC, was signed [in Pavia](https://i.imgur.com/6tXWRF3.jpg) this past weekend [uniting nations on four different continents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLE_7--6KKAlFcAEehP4Zar586HZzmKe2Kwu5EKsOq0/edit) including Pavia, Pridelands, Venne, and the Imperial Federation.
- Cortesia del Mar has elected its first presidential slate, with President IceCarim and Vice President Yodabird19. [The debate](https://discord.com/channels/415706745566920714/1003791821429801031/1031334864894578730) happened in the aforementioned Peachtree Plaza.
- Winterbourne [announced a declaration of peace](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y2lgql/declaration_of_peace_winterbourne_the_temporal/) between it and the Temporal Isles, except they were never really at war in the first place so it's more of a friendship treaty?
- Pavia's longest serving Crown Prince, BritishWanderer III [has died due to "total organ failure."](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/957405493435973692/1030784257930571786), with Creepion I becoming the new Crown Prince.
- [Cissonius of Pavia announces the Monument Group](https://](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y5t3ue/announcing_the_successor_to_gabon_corp_the/)), a successor to Civclassic's Gabon Corp.
- [CivMC's latest update](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/952312337065451530/1029455033328205927) made various fixes to XP, bookkeeping, and City Spawns, but [was pulled only an hour later](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/952312337065451530/1029471032114942062) after issues arose.
- [CivReign's latest teaser](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1029630617358446592) hints at a more comprehensive transportation system, including overground rail buffs and a boat rework.

- I actually like [these propaganda posters from the Imperial Federation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y3z33b/the_imperial_federation_needs_you_join_today/), but did you really have to redo Uncle Sam?

### Metagame Highlights

- Not to brag, but I've [received the Lambatan of the Month award](https://discord.com/channels/810436686021394492/812258748285845525/1029976514999111711), so no big deal
- [bgbba reminds people](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y510c0/an_observation_on_server_population/) that this period after banning toxic individuals has been a boon to server population.
    - But then it feels incredibly weird for [Ian_X12 to be in the comments basically advertising Stoneworks](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/y510c0/an_observation_on_server_population/ishgspx/), despite the fact he ran a Civ server in the past.
