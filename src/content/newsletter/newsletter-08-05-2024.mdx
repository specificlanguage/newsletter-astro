Hello and happy August from the Pacific Northwest!

I can only speak for myself but it definitely feels like this summer has felt like a decade both in Civ terms and in IRL. There's been so much happening that it's finally nice that this week the news was relatively slow. I don't have to think about writing long pieces for stupid stuff -- although I'm going to have to this week at this rate anyway.

But I've barely squeaked this one out as I've got Blue Angels flying over my area every hour. I guess that's what happens when you live near a major national landmark, but alas...

Are we ready for the news?

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is a view over the Commonwealth hills to the Tricon building, one of the major landmarks of the country. Now, this *isn't* the Lyrean Commonwealth, don't get it confused, The Commonwealth (the original, you might say) is getting more active right now, and even though this build was purpose built for a competition, I don't think people really find the builds in Commonwealth as often as I think they should. Their builds are perfectly integrated with their jungle environment unlike many of other civilizations on Civ, and I think it deserves some highlight on how good their building skills are.

### Featured Article

*This week's featured article is a rerun (with slight modifications) from October 24, 2022.*

**[Alexandria](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Alexandria)**, officially the Free City of Alexandria, was a country on [CivRealms](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms) self-described as “founded with the desire to provide a friendly place for newfriends to learn about basic server mechanics and the history of the server”. Growing from a Brewer's Guild, the city became the server’s most populous area, and seceded from [Varathia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varathia) due to its growing population. After neighboring countries became involved in the [Ez2War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Ez2War), the country was raided for several days by the raider group. Later in the server's life, the country was involved in the USA War while simultaneously dealing with an attempted coup back at home.

The main building in the city was the Newfriend Manor, intended as an entry point for newfriends to be introduced to the mechanics and plugins on the server. Among other landmarks in the city are the Statue of Athena, Temple of Sarapis, Ampitheatre, and the Lighthouse. Like many other countries, the country held territory in CivRealms’ various expansions, in this case, Solitude in the [Thomas Archipelago](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Thomas_Archipelago). The country served as a quality example for newfriend orientation, however no direct successor in [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC) was created.

*This week's featured image is the Statue of Athena at the entrypoint of Alexandria City.*

## The News

![](https://i.imgur.com/p7km18V.png)

*SPQR's Senate Chamber (cr: Mark_Antony)*

### Around the Server

- A moderate amount of drama happened this week in Anisso. The way I'm seeing it, it comes down to three unrelated storylines that come into one story:
  - [logicnotskilled and szepess raided Anisso and the Holy See, respectively](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1eh28ib/a_summary_of_events_so_far/) as part of a small war between the two countries. Coolchacha was tasked to pearl either of them but only pearled szepess, but seeking logicnotskilled's pearl.
  - [szepess, in response, abdicated from the throne of Anisso](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehp3xp/instrument_of_abdication_from_his_majesty_the/), and hoped that the country would die. Comments under the post had [him come under significant fire after he pretty much neglected the safety of his citizens and country's actions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehp3xp/instrument_of_abdication_from_his_majesty_the/lg0tve4/) The [ATS also was upset about the country's actions and freedom citizens in tandem with szepess' intention to leave.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehp3xp/instrument_of_abdication_from_his_majesty_the/lg1kcxw/?context=10000)
  - Crimson_Celak [then became the King of Anisso, left to pick up the pieces from the Anisso craziness.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehp3xp/instrument_of_abdication_from_his_majesty_the/lg0vrju/)
- Meanwhile, literally on the other side of the world, [Coolchacha was pearled in Pavia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehw8uh/pavian_special_military_operation_never_seen/)
  - Pavia has not formally addressed it, but it is most likely due to [his deliberate jumping into the country's vault.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehw8uh/pavian_special_military_operation_never_seen/lg2bz28/) This is despite the fact that while "Thanatos" was storing the pearls, it is questionable whether the country has a working vault, let alone bunker.
  - While this had to do with the war as Coolchacha was carrying pearls, which were freed by Gobblin, the pearls previously gained in the former story were freed pretty soon after, so that's cool.
- Wafflenation [announced their move from Alenarith, choosing to resettle in former Temporal Isles territory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehovjx/wafflenation_newupdated_claims/)
  - This is despite the fact [that he still currently pearled](https://i.imgur.com/TzCCPw9.png), so that sounds fun.
  - Meanwhile, Truidencia wasted no time [reclaiming the land Wafflenation vacated as part of a re-extension of their Gensokyo stewardship.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehvl9s/the_holy_truidencian_empires_imperial_landsraad/)
- Pavia announced that [they would be establishing a mayoral office for the City](https://i.imgur.com/MCzqs0g.png), with elections to be held on Saturday, with CedarValiant, Hakr, and Ahri as current candidates. That last candidate isn't a joke.
- Codey was [released by the Imperial Federation on parole, after being involved in a Communist plot in previous weeks.](https://i.imgur.com/HjsNQcE.png)
  - His news outlet, the Imperial Times (of which you'll see more later) also [introduced Segment Scripts, Replays, and Videos as bounty opportunities for players.](https://i.imgur.com/iusLUIl.png)
- [Aeros has returned](https://i.imgur.com/X809q6X.png) following a rebranding of the discord from the Book Club.
- [Forged and Sadchamp created Accra](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1eiqwan/formation_of_the_accran_city_state_accra/), a new city state north of Iria. Usually, I don't highlight new nations, but it's interesting seeing these two players make a nation after being consistent higher-ups in Icenia.
- [Petrichor land was given to Pacem](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ehraji/breaking_icenia_gives_old_petrichor_to_pacem/) following their inactivity (or more accurately, becoming Columbia).
- Icenia [also elected their newest Senate](https://i.imgur.com/OKnYqro.png), with Southshire's Gentle__Giant becoming a Senator for the first time.
- Transylvania [announced they would be renaming the country by simply adding the word "Grand"](https://i.imgur.com/ikDMNBp.png). Hey, also please stop doing Ctrl-F, read the newsletter naturally
- Volterra and Icenia both handed out awards for their citizens.
  - [Auqust and Enforcer won awards](https://i.imgur.com/Hxrb5Mg.png) for Medal of Honor and Engineer of the Month respectively, with [DuckWithAMonocle winning Icenian of the Month.](https://i.imgur.com/3touzKZ.png)
  - [Prudence, Cokebrothers, and Lucifer were also inducted to the Order of Nox to their contributions in Volterra.](https://i.imgur.com/3Fp9Cdt.png)

- Hams Head & Fish [opened a new shop in Transylvania's Cluj,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ej8br4/get_all_your_player_head_needs_at_hams_heads_fish/) boasting "the largest head collection on CivMC".

- [Seekinq is back at work again with a new Visitor Center in Griffin that looks perfect](https://i.imgur.com/0s6y7BZ.jpeg)
- Meanwhile [this picture of Griffin for the Imperial Times has impressive layering tech that I don't usually pull off](https://i.imgur.com/HeYW0V6.png) (cr: Codey)
- It's funny that most people don't really know that the countryside of Pavia has great builds, [like this greenhouse in Vetranio, built by paagf](https://i.imgur.com/POSiNN7.jpeg)! (cr: Urzork)
- [SPQR's Senate hall looks incredible](https://i.imgur.com/p7km18V.png), maybe House of Commons like? Hehe (cr: Mark_Antony)

### Cool Content

- As per usual, here's [this month's claims map expertly crafted by TheJmqn](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1eh1xu5/civmc_unofficial_claims_map_29_famous_last_words/)

- Imperial Times released [its newest edition talking about the end of the Wet Bandits.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ej19kv/imperial_times_4/)

- [I do like HamburgerLord's simplistic ads for Hams' Head and Fish, very cool](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ej8br4/get_all_your_player_head_needs_at_hams_heads_fish/)
- [Nebula released footage from the country's pearling of ZibeKabir](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1ef4ta9/temporarily_declassified/), and yeah you're right I definitely could have described it funnier than I did a couple weeks ago

### Memes

- [Insert average "Civ" YouTube competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1egfglb/if_i_had_a_nation_for_everytime_this_happened/)

### Non-Civ Content

- I've been meaning to highlight this channel for a while, but [the Washington Post has a shorts channel](https://www.youtube.com/@washingtonpostuniverse) that's actually kind of funny and makes the news bearable -- and it [also has the good version of JD Vance](https://youtube.com/shorts/tJdldECOYh0)
- Something has infected Pavia discord -- and it's **Farm Merge Valley**. [Completely tanked this week's productivity.](https://i.imgur.com/cIjQRB3.png)

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/POSiNN7.jpeg)

*A greenhouse out in Vetranio, Pavia* (cr: Urzork).

Last week, we had **80 responses.** This is, once again, more than usual, as we've usually had 50 responses most weeks, so why are poll numbers spiking up once again? Hmmmmmmmmm.....

### First Play Date

The first question was how long it was since your first log-in to Civ.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fbuxO5d.png)

It spikes around 2 years, since that's when CivMC started, which makes sense, but this also sort of shows that the recruitment pattern for CivMC has actually been relatively consistent over time and people have been staying on the server for a while -- according to this poll, the *majority* of respondants have never known a life before CivMC.

You may be wondering what the gap in 6 - 7 years is, since that's a major dip in the oldfriend population. That was around 2017-2018, Somber War era. CivClassic at the time was definitely the top dog, but Civ as a genre wasn't focusing as much on recruitment until maybe 2019, especially once CivRealms 2.2 came onto the scene, which is why you see more numbers in the 3 - 5 yrs mark.

Of course, it always is quite interesting seeing so many people in the 10+ years section, you've really been wasting your life!

### Feedback Discord Channels

About 18 people thought the feedback channels were helpful, while 14 people didn't. Some interesting responses were:

> There's nothing more frustrating than trying to get a question in #general when some high visibility topic is getting talked about, or having to sort through 500+ comments while you stepped away for a few hours

> those channels are very important. just wish the admins were more excited about new ideas in suggestions and more supportive of new ideas.

> Sometimes, I feel that the admins are slow to [implement] things that would really shake up the server. The Civ reinforced obsidian meta gets very boring after a while. They need to shake things up.

> Civ desperately needs someone with a vision that can resist community pressure and create a complete experience conducive to geopolitics without having to wait for conflict (lol) to see if the balance is good.

> Once in a while a good idea comes along and it gets some traction in suggestions, but it just serves as a what-if simulator. Feedback is generally quite useful though.

Something interesting from that last response though:

> I'm a mod and I have community support muted also aside from pings... sorry!


I will say a lot of these responses desperately highlight the need for a second experimental server -- something that Civ hasn't seen in a while. Prior to CivClassics, you would usually see a much less populated but more interesting server that would be willing to take more development and gameplay element risks. As a mainline server, changes to CivMC are usually pretty hard to execute due to the majority of the playerbase, but servers like Devoted (before 3.0), Bergecraft, and even arguably CivRealms experimented enough that brought changes back into mainline -- some of the suggestions and feedback. Civ+ may argue they fill in this niche currently, but its presence on 1.8 is going backwards... not quite as easy.

Of course, it is generally not profitable or reasonable to make another Civ server so unfortunately we're stuck with this state.

I do want to make a "links guide" as I've mentioned before so old & new people can find answers to questions that have been parotted before in one place.

### Vote Now!

Sorry, I phoned the poll in this week. Couldn't think of intriguing questions fast enough.

## Midnight Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hn3J3TS.png)

*Max_imil & company at Pavia's Town Hall* (cr: Max_imil).

Sorry if this week's edition was shorter or less quality than usual. Was a little rushing around this weekend and totally didn't lose sleep or anything this week for work-related reasons that I shouldn't have. Seriously. I didn't.

If you'd like to help make this newsletter **I will be paying out diamonds for those who'd like to help write auxiliary materials**, so feel free to reach out to me `@specificlanguage`! Always appreciate the support.

Besides that, I slightly did lie last week about all the backfills being there: there's a gap of newsletters between September and October 2022 that I missed which I'll fill eventually. Sorry!

Other than that, I think it's time for me to head to sleep. Until next week folks,
