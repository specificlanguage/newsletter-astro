## Editor's Note

![](/old/Paviatownhall.png)

*[This week's featured image is the Pavian Town Hall](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/3/38/Paviatownhall.png), [opened last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vito3i/a_townhall_big_enough_for_the_whole_town_pavias/) by Pavian Crown Prince BritishWanderer II.*


Last week after some constructive criticism from many people, I've decided to make a few changes.
- The long drama writeups that were present last week are intended to be a lot shorter, mostly to let other people interpret their own views and to put more of the writing on CivWiki itself. As always, I try to keep these newsletters as unbiased as possible while providing an informed-as-possible view of the news at hand.
- I've reordered the newsletter to be more representative of the community, so I'm moving around a few pieces and would love pieces of feedback.

You may also noticed [**there is a visual Markdown version of this newsletter this week**](https://hackmd.io/srCiywD0SCCj1qFWGgAV_Q). This allows me to better pace the content and to incorporate more of the amazing screenshots posted on Reddit that nobody gets to see. At the moment, this is a temporary measure; I'm exploring ways to make this more accessible like [the Pavia Tribune](https://tribune.pavia.institute/) or [the Wikipedia Signpost.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost)

I've gotten a lot of support for writing these newsletters every week, and so many people I've talked to are so appreciative of the newsletter every week, and I am absolutely grateful for all your support.

## Featured Article

*This week's featured article was co-written by u/Yodabird19, u/tvman2, and u/morsden67 (specificlanguage), and this week's image is [a render of the skyline of Downtown Mount Augusta in CivClassic](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/f/f9/MtAClassicsATCOverhead.png) by u/jasonbord.*

[**Mount Augusta's** iteration on CivClassic 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivClassic_2.0)) was a large city state centered around democracy, legalism and limited government. After its initial stint near [Tierra de Conciencia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Tierra_de_Conciencia) the country settled near [The Commonwealth](https://civwiki.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth_(CivClassic_2.0)) and became a populous center of activity near the middle of the map. The city played a major role in the start of the [NATO-Mir War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/NATO-Mir_War), or [Infinity War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Infinity_War) and had ten mayors over the server's lifespan. 

The city was also an economic and cultural capital of the server; the [Maester Alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Maester_Alliance), a bookkeeping organization, and the [Order of St. Marcus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Marcus) had its headquarters in [Shardore Tower Library](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Shardore_Tower_Library). The Augustan Trade Center and nearby Mount Augusta Mall had numerous local and international shops, and the city organized and held the [Fourth Olympics](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Fourth_Olympics) on the server. 

The city had many distinct districts which also became its own territories, such as [South Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/South_Augusta), [Sealand](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Sealand), [Insula](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Insula), and the [Union of Socialist Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Union_of_Socialist_Augusta). The city collapsed after players migrated over to [a new iteration in CivRealms 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivRealms_2.0)), while much of its territory was inherited by [Mount September](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_September).

Oh boy, do we have a lot this week. Get your pants and comment section ready.

#### Updates from Kū & Estalia
- After tensions with Estalia, the Communion of Kū's territory and city was griefed by Estalian players, and Kū-toans were forced to move from their former claims. [Black_Fusion was subsequently pearled.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vgzxla/estalias_latest_mining_haul/)
- Estalia's view of the conflict [can be seen here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vgkt62/estaliaku_situation_response_and_resolution/) and Kū's view of the conflict [can be seen here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vh02cy/update_from_the_k%C5%AB_diaspora/)
- International response [was highly sympathetic](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vgmerc/who_wants_to_be_next/) towards Kū's cause, and a coalition led by Gensokyo has [announced an embargo of Estalian goods](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vifejw/a_response_to_estalia/), something that Estalia has [heavily advertised](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vifejw/a_response_to_estalia/idcr7hj/) for.

#### Updates from Mount Augusta
- Mount Augusta governor ComradeNick and judges Cattus_ and Asakuun_v2 revoked various Augustans citizenship, including governor candidate Ahme63. 
- This was in response to Ahme63 and supporters [maliciously overclaiming land](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtAugusta/comments/vhaf5g/no_good_options/) that was recently claimed for government purposes, also raising concerns that the country claimed to their own country of ParadICE. [More explanation here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtAugusta/comments/vhaf5g/no_good_options/id8k6np/)
- While unprecedented, ComradeNick has made efforts to curb side effects by [reinstating Fairbyfly's citizenship,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vi0a85/a_rebuttal_to_comrade_nicks_actions_in_mount/idab7fl/) a citizen caught up in the action.

#### Poortea Stuff Again, Letting Him Get More Attention Again
- NetherPearled, a [former citizen of the Hyperborean Federation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vjv30j/hyperborean_response_to_netherpearleds_bounty/) was [pearled by Blockchainistan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vjl91c/hate_crime_netherpearled_wanted_for_antisemitic/) for antisemitic comments.
- It turns out that NetherPearled was actually a VPN-alt of [poortea](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Poortea), who has logged into and banned from previous civ servers for similar offensive comments.
- [Rhode Island players were accused](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vk1496/rhode_island_leadership_being_banned_for_not/) of knowingly not reporting poortea, however these bans were quickly investigated and reversed due to a misunderstanding.

#### An Attempted Coup in KOEL

- Lurxo, a high ranking official in the Kingdom of ErrorL, [attempted to inside the country by coordinating with other nations in secret](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vgu5qd/the_current_state_of_the_koel/), such as the nearby Caliphate. Before his discovery, he also raided much of the city.
- After being outed by ErrorL, on Lurxo's next login, Lurxo pearled herobrine_nm, a citizen of KOEL. However, Lurxo was [quickly pearled and is awaiting trial](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vimt1o/an_update_on_lurxo_the_traitor_the_fool_who/) in the ErrorL courts.

#### Elections
- Petrichor [held its first elections](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vk1eyo/first_official_petrichor_election_results/) and elected MetalHusband as its first General Secretary. Other members elected to high positions are SirBoss, shadedoom, and Goosie_Goose.

- The election also coincided with the [constitution coming into effect, allowing foreigners to settle and make shops.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/vgnpoy/in_other_news_icenia_is_opening_up_to_foreign/)
