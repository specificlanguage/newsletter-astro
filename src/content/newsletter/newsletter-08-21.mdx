Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

It's a shorter newsletter this week, as the dog days of summer are winding down and everyone's heading back to school, it's time to reflect on how your summer went. Good? Bad? Just ok?

To me, it was a summer full of ups, but a good amount of downs and I've yet to figure out what to do. I might be doing the newsletter for a few weeks or a few months, we'll see how it goes.

Time to get on with the news!

This week's featured image is reffelruz's view of Verdant Valley and the Tricon Industries building in the Commonwealth. After a couple months of delay (oops!) I'm proudly announcing it as the winner of the [picture competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/13duu08/picture_competition_for_the_newsletter/). Its wide variety of build styles, structures seamlessly built into the landscape, and integration of nature into every aspect is something else. A well deserved prize for a well deserved country!

### Featured Article

**[Kaltsburg](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Kaltsburg)'s iteration on CivClassic 2.0** was a German-themed monarchy focused on amicable foreign relations and realistic builds. Founded near [Varkonia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varkonia) in 2018, the country received significant support from [SPQR](https://civwiki.org/wiki/SPQR) in their early days due to continued raids in the territory. The country maintained amicable relations with most nations on the server; the country was never involved in any wars and became an observer state of the [first United Northern Congress](https://civwiki.org/wiki/United_Northern_Congress_(created_2018)) and the [Council of the Medi Sea](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Medi_Sea). The country had several provinces, whose leaders made up a council to advice King deyan. After a hiatus in 2020, the leaders decided to move the country over to the western quadrants for more land.

The country focused on both infrastructure and exporting their German culture, with its simplistic yet distinctly baroque European builds, and building up a trade network through construction of a market and the [Great Overland Railway](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_Overland_Railway) passing nearby. They also established a national brewery, which experimented with the [Brewery](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Brewery) plugin. The country's Italian-spiritual successor, [Florence](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Florence), briefly claimed territory in [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC), but were annexed by [Kallos](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Kallos) following the [Generic War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Generic_War).

### Happenings Around Civ

Even shorter this week....

- The Commonwealth was set to hold a Maester ceremony to induct Jensen3rd and ImmediateDescent into the Maester Alliance, but [ImmediateDescent could not make it](https://i.imgur.com/7FrafrW.png).
- The Imperial Federation elected [ImmediateDescent as their newest chancellor](https://i.imgur.com/DEla1Oh.png), hopefully resolving their crisis
- Meracydia is facing a narcotics epidemic with foreign suppliers, drunkenness, and animal transformations. Don't believe me? [Read the Meracydian Mouthpiece for more](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/15r76x7/the_meracydian_mouthpiece_8142023/).
- Transylvania has elected [fastestgrass as their newest President,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/15w2sjl/transylvanian_diet_and_presidential_inauguration/) with their inauguration ceremony set to be held in the Icenia nether portal.
- Nara [announced due to waning interest, all megadraw lottery entrants would be refunded.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/15qteos/megadraw_update/) I do want to see a successful lottery happen on Civ, it would be very cool.
- Mount Augusta [inducted its newest mayor, Podly to grand affair after a close election with Flameoguy](https://i.imgur.com/rxUthnf.png). I hope he doesn't mind me saying that Flameo's "consolation prize" was becoming deputy mayor, [along with several other high-ranking officials gaining positions](https://i.imgur.com/rCGNMPK.png) in their cabinet.
- Lambat [is electing its newest Metro Council](https://i.imgur.com/0O7U9CF.png), with so many left-field candidates including me, and Creepi0n, and even Kaprediem that things are just getting stupid
- Pavia [offering incentives to build more, with more diamonds going into their bank account for completed schematics.](https://i.imgur.com/2ZKI9sC.png)


### Metagame Highlights

- [Hands of the Earth has a new wiki page.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Hands_of_the_Earth)
- [Golden Nations, a survival server, has announced they would be using Citadel](https://i.imgur.com/j4TNaaS.png) (and subsequently, the entire Civ plugin suite) for their next iteration of their server. It's with mixed reception [although quite a vocal minority](https://i.imgur.com/CAD5SIq.png)
- It's *kind of* related but if you're not aware in the Minecraft community, [people have generally declared 2b2t's recent 1.19 update as the death of the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7Derad54fw). Is it time to make another run for advertising?

Thanks everyone for participating

### Multimedia Projects

- alberlb96 [shows off the SPQR territory map to r/imaginarymaps](https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/15tv0ni/map_of_spqr_a_roman_themed_nation_in_minecraft/)

### Memes

![](https://i.imgur.com/rhZ8Agp.jpg)

*Slowlyfunny's new Amogus in Icenia. I'm obligated to put this here because of him.*

- I may? [I think I'm aware enough to know that I am stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/15rhc2k/i_may_be_stupid_but/)
- Ah yes, my favorite picture, [GhasNews.exe not found](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/15uvowo/ghas_news_were_barack/)

You're serious? That's all the memes that I have this week? What the fuck is wrong with you guys post your bullshit on reddit more...

### Non-Civ Content

- Many will be incredibly happy that the New York Yankees are all but collapsing with 6 losses in a row since Friday. From [sluggish trade deadline trades](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2023/07/31/new-york-yankees-mlb-trade-deadline-needs-last-place/70496110007/), to [incredibly weak offense (along with historically great offense from a single person)](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/15whds4/from_cbs_sports_just_shows_the_insane_run_jrod_is/), [scandals](https://nypost.com/2023/08/03/domingo-german-was-belligerent-in-clubhouse-before-alcohol-treatment/), [umpire temper tantrums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcJfVJhkNuc), and SO much more. As a Red Sox fan, [it's only more amusing for me to see!](https://www.espn.com/mlb/boxscore/_/gameId/401472843)
- So after the calmness of Pikmin 3, the next game to look at is [Bomb Rush Cyberfunk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353230/Bomb_Rush_Cyberfunk/), a game reminiscent of the Jet Set Radio games on the Dreamcast/OG XBOX. Play the game all you want, but for me, [my money's on the killer soundtrack with techno artists and original JSR composers alike.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwOixiP3cBU) Every song is perfect for this game and keeps you funkin' along.
- I'm trying to make changes by not starting coding projects that take incredibly long times but I have big ideas that I have to keep burning on the backburner so uh, coding moment
- Nara did a funny gaming night! I don't think anybody was there though :(

### Poll of the Week

Last week, we had a total of **72 responses.** I think it might just be the appeal of the questions that are getting this amount of variance in the responses.

The first question was **"How many hours do you play Civ per day?"**

![](https://i.imgur.com/bo8nT3u.png)

It seems all the people who didn't play Civ is no longer here. Did I scare you off?

I kind of expected the first two to be high, because of the logins and daily essence getters being so plentiful on Civ, but what's surprised me is that we don't have a steady taper off, but that we have a large peak at 1-2 hours a day taking over the entire landscape. To be fair, I game for like 1-2 hours for relaxing time at the end of the day too.

---

The second question last week was **Roughly how frequently do you look at non-game Civ content?**, usually colloquially referred to as the "metagame".

![](https://i.imgur.com/cPyzvQw.png)

This is one I think more of us expected. While Civ is a game that is played on the server, unlike other anarchy servers, the metagame, from the politics and news and dramaposts, and so much more, is integral to being able to integrate within the Civ playstyle. Heck, you're doing it right now reading this post!

#### 2 Vote 2 Furious

This week's poll is about a *very* topical topic (and totally not because I had nothing else to think about this week.)

<ColoredBlock color="bg-sky-200" darkColor="dark:bg-sky-950">
    <Poll client:load submitURL={"/newsletter-08-21"} questions={
        [
            {
                questionID: "2b2t",
                question: "Would recruiting players from other anarchy servers be good for Civ? Put more simply, is Civ an anarchy server?",
                options: [
                    "Yes, anarchy players fit Civ's playstyle",
                    "Yes, but not every anarchy group fits in with Civ's playstyle",
                    "Maybe, you'll need to convince people why Civ is a better alternative to other 2b2t clones",
                    "No, but off-meta players like builders or PvPers could gel well with Civ's playstyle",
                    "No, anarchy players don't fit Civ's playstyle"
                ],
                type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,
                useOther: false,
                required: true
            }
        ]
    }/>
</ColoredBlock>

I'm mostly asking this question because as some of you know, [2b2t's update to 1.19 has been an unmitigated disaster.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIykm_s_CJs) My offchance thought is if Civ would want to capitalize on its failure.

## Concluding Cry for Help

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/963450138192404491/1141914639429541970/2023-08-17_18.22.19.png)

Thanks for reading this week's newsletter! Some things you may want to note:

- If you'd like to contribute to the newsletter, my DMs are always open `@specificlanguage`. Honestly, writing a featured article is easier than you think.
- If that's not your fancy, feel free to write something and bring it out to me, whether thoughts on Civ's metagame or just other things you wanted to rant on.

Additionally, while I'm still trying to figure out how the hell I can do a fundraiser (hint: I'm lazy), I can at least direct people to a couple donation areas to help support Maui following their wildfires:

- The [Maui Strong Foundation](https://www.hawaiicommunityfoundation.org/maui-strong) is focusing on providing general aid for all of Maui
- The [Maui Food Bank](https://mauifoodbank.org/donate/) is helping families stay fed during this difficult time.

I'm hoping something good comes out of the newsletter very soon. Thanks for your support!
