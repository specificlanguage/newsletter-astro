Good morning and happy Monday from the Pacific Northwest!

I think I shocked people a little bit when I announced this is the **penultimate** weekly newsletter, honestly it's kinda funny see at least a few people freak about what's going on.

But I guess I need to let people know about it at the top -- even though the **weekly** format is ending, this newsletter will become an expansive **monthly** publication. I'll explain more after we get through a bit of the news!

## Featured

### Featured Image

![](https://i.imgur.com/FbmKTQX.jpeg)

This week's featured image is of Pavia's revamped town hall gardens. I've been keeping track of this work with Gobblin, Tatsu and the Dukes and they've really done a huge revamp. Although the most obvious addition is the Christmas tree, if you look further into the area they've got extensive water features, lovely arches, incredible bridges, and more creative flower displays to boot. We rarely talk about landscaping & nature-centric builds on Civ, but I have to say that good landscape makes the surrounding buildings & scenery even more beautiful.

### Featured Article

*This week's featured article is a repeat of [February 20, 2023.](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-02-20/)*

[**CivRealms**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms) was a long-running Civ server, having storied history in the Civ genre. The goal of CivRealms was to provide a different mechanical experience than the mainline servers it ran alongside, like [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft) and [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic). Its most well known iteration, 2.0, ran from May 2019 and well into 2021. The administration were also much more involved in player interactions; although making controversial decisions, they were committed to making the server a safe and enjoyable place for its playerbase.

Many countries who were active on other servers, such as [CivEx](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivEx) or [Devoted](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Devoted) settled on the server. Throughout its lifespan conflicts between players emerged, including the [Hell War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/First_Hell_War) and the [Great War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Great_War_(CivRealms_2.0)). Additionally, several countries emerged with their own culture, like [Carbon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Carbon) and [Alexandria](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Alexandria), as well as other nations on the server's expansions, the [Thomas Archipelago](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Thomas_Archipelago) and the [New World](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_World). While CivRealms is no longer an active server, its philosophies have continued in the development of other future servers. **[(Full article...)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms)**

*This week's featured picture is the city of Zexenia, on the coast of the main continent of CivRealms.*

### This Week In Civ

<ColoredBlock color="bg-red-200" darkColor="dark:bg-red-950">

  On the week of December 16 - December 22 in:

  [2022](/newslet):

  - Ocala was obbybombed by [Arnen](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Arnen) after the territory was dissolved and annexed by the latter country.
  - CivMC admins discovered abuse of the Brewery after finding out players were brewing powerful utility brews, and rebalanced recipes to compensate. Superbgamer was one of the primary offenders.
  - The [Monument Group](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Monument_Group) based in [Pavia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Pavia) held the server's first public stock sale, raising over 2,000 diamonds from investors.
  - Mount Augusta has reelected ComradeNick as its mayor, with laws passed to annex Juliana (formerly Zatoka) and broker alliances with New Jersey and Gang Shi.

  [2023]():

  - CivMC released a well-received fishing update the previous weekend as a celebration of the holidays; but due to continued crashes and lost reinforcements, the update was eventually rolled back only a couple days following its launch.
  - The [Grasslands Gambit](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grasslands_Gambit) reached its conclusion after Gang Shi fighters were pearled and the [Dawn Guard Pact](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Dawn_Guard_Pact), consisting of [Yoahtl](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yoahtl) and [Icenia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Icenia), broke the [Butternut County](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Butternut_County) vault. The countries unclaimed most of Gang Shi's allies' land.
  - Following the conclusion of the war, [Gang Shi](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gang_Shi) groups were handed to Estalia, with minor conflict over the handling, possession of and continued construction within the territory.
  - Arsenia and [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta), along with other [BUILD](https://civwiki.org/wiki/BUILD) allies, [declared war on Doom City](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Doom_City_Conflict) citing raiding, harassment, and communication issues.
  - SPQR held a Saturnalia festival to celebrate the holidays; their allies, Vinland also contributed by hosting cat girl caroling across the server.
  - Monument Group's flagship store in Pavia received a massive renovation over the weekend, expanding its number of shops.

## "New Format"??

![](https://i.imgur.com/JaJQgmt.png)

Here's a sneak peek of what the new format's going to look like! In the virtue of looking closer to a news-magazine (such as the *The Atlantic* or *The Economist*), nearly *every* one of these sections you've been reading will be expanded, along with new writers to fill in some of their own items.

This will range from opinion sections (like SpeedyJustice's opinion sections [he wrote earlier this year](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-02-05-2024/#columns)), to more specialized news sections (like economics, of which I usually have limited visibility for), interviews, and a whole lot more.

Because of the length this will inevitably take, I've split this up into multple sections for readability, so you don't have to keep scrolling down to find your news, it will all be in one place (generally).

Now, I have to stress -- **nearly everything you've come to know and love about the newsletter will not be gone**. Polls, fun stuff, and yes, even the Non-Civ Content will remain -- albeit in a slightly revamped format.

TL;DR, the newsletter won't gone, we're just evolving!

I'm putting the Christmas pictures on next week, sorry!

### Server Update

CivMC [made a minor update this past weekend](https://i.imgur.com/givtNnE.png). This included:

- Updating the server to 1.21.3, which adds bundles, a highly requested feature specifically for Civ
- Adjustments to Meteoric Iron tools & armor:
  - Increased armor & toughness
  - Allows stonecutter variants of stone blocks to also be instantly mined, as well expand their scope to cobblestone and andesite-like blocks
  - Axes now allow insta-break of wood stairs and slabs
- Allow backpacks to contain compacted items (a buff to an underused item)
- Increase in factory upgrade recipe output (4 -> 6)
- Removes the functionality that would boot you out of /ctf mode if making an invalid place
- Allow strip reinforcement of copper

It is worth noting that the old Meteoric Iron Tools and Armor do not have their values updated, [you have to request an update from the admins themselves via a Discord ticket.](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/984106987207925780)

The update however, broke some old bots as they also sneakily updated anti-cheat within this update, [Okx have said they would further update the server the next day.](https://i.imgur.com/givtNnE.png)

### Around the Server

#### North

- The [OKAY Union announced that they would be disbanding](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hadzuf/the_end_of_the_union_experimentation_ill_stop/), citing real-life affairs, but say that collaborations between the countries will continue.
- [Khaledonia and Eldoria ended their alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hadc6l/the_end_of_the_pact/), although no reason was given and was a pretty hastily written announcement.
- Monument Group [announced a slew of changes](https://i.imgur.com/NReU23y.png), including the highly-anticipated custom sort code changes.
  - This update also included inactivity checkers, escrow accounts, and freeze features for stock incompliance.
  - Monument Group then re-offered *several* of its mostly highly requested sort codes, [now including those with letters, for a high prices](https://i.imgur.com/dQnyWzh.png) (with no buyout)
  - The company also began [publicly selling Heliodor and Meteoric Iron pickaxes, at extremely high prices](https://i.imgur.com/G8DMqjf.png)
- SPQR are [holding Saturnalia right now!](https://i.imgur.com/6Cg9XXI.png)
- Over the weekend, Pavia [tore down the wall between their country and neighboring protectorate Mehri,](https://i.imgur.com/9NXN0tJ.png) uniting the two nations within the Lyrean Commonwealth.
  - Meanwhile, [CedarValiant was elected as the newest mayor of Pavia City](https://i.imgur.com/6XbzR52.png).
- Volterra finished its latest elections with ItzHoover being elected as Lord Paramount, [along with several other notable Volterrans being appointed cabinet positions](https://i.imgur.com/s0UEcuJ.png)
- The Exyrian Exorcists [defeat the Icenian Isopods in the last semifinal of the International Hockey League](https://i.imgur.com/6LqGD4G.png), 7-5!

#### South

- [Amiticia also disbanded this past week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hak4ad/from_the_pen_of_the_amictian_royal_office/), citing a lack of interest internally and externally.
  - Their territory will be taken over by the Imperial Federation, one of their closest allies.
  - <EdNote>warning, opinion</EdNote> Honestly, it was one of the better new nations on Civ and I'm a little sad to see them go
- Meanwhile, the [Imperial Federation and Salerno entered a bilateral military alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1harqi7/salerno_the_if_establish_a_military_alliance/), committing to mutual defense between the two countries in the area.
- The Imperial Federation [announced that their rail line to 0,0 is now complete](https://i.imgur.com/pCtl4jX.png), providing easy service to their nation from major travel centers.
- The Diamond Chronicler [released some documents](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5WV8TsV9zLrseQse1jvXAgF5X_uwvh5/view) that allege that VolutionFS was mistried; the anonymous author(s) called for a proper non-corrupt trial.
  - This was not endorsed by the Diamond Chronicler themselves, however, [just under 1/2 of respondents to a poll thought that VolutionFS was not judged fairly](https://i.imgur.com/GsEFk9W.png)
- ElHouso attempted to pearl Wormseed but ultimately failed, and was pearled himself. [See the post for more details](https://i.imgur.com/LAvMCr5.png) (cr. posted from the Diamond Chronicle).
- Newseum attempted to raid Marstria, [but were stopped by Salernite officials.](https://i.imgur.com/ZgrQLS1.png)
  - [Bronnakus also thanked several players for their assistance in Salerno as well as plans for the rest of his term.](https://i.imgur.com/MB62QYN.png)
- [A bounty was posted for CryptoClixy's pearl](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hemrw7/bounty_500d_for_cryptoclixys_pearl/) for "mugging [nje331] in the nether and acting as an elitist"
  - This was then uh... [resolved easily in-person in Pavia.](https://i.imgur.com/ntNmzLm.png) That was easy and not worth making a post about.
- Nara [decorated Orakuru as part of their holiday celebrations.](https://i.imgur.com/PIiJuT4.png)


### Metagame Highlights

- Arthirob [introduced some beginner guides for people to learn MacroMod!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hecxb8/arthirob_free_macros_and_the_training_ground_a/)
- Despite the fact that CivMC probably has some of the best "[guides](https://wiki.civmc.net)", [we get posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hb7arg/pearling_sentence/) on Discord and the subreddit occasionally. Is there something wrong with discovery?
  - To be clear, I don't mind these, but [asking questions that have been documented earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hcqaf6/whats_to_stop_people_from_just_griefing_all_the/) are kind of ehhhh
- After [demands to relay Server Updates on the CivMC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hevq2z/feedback_major_announcements_on_server_updates_on/), Cosmojynx [took it upon himself to relay the server update](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hf4sb8/server_update_december_15th_2024/)
  - Part of the reason I put the server updates as the first thing when talking about news here is *because* nobody gets real updates on the subreddit. I'm glad somebody noticed.
- Pandastical [is looking for Generic War footage](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hf80up/does_anyone_have_any_good_footage_from_the/). I'm sure I know what his next video is...

### Cool Content

- Welcome to the final **[CivMC Slander of 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hd1ale/civmc_slander_7_quick_before_2024_ends_edition/)** -- how will people ever survive with no weekly newsletters?!
- The fact that someone, let alone [Kaprediem, making a **several** Civ-related covers of songs is quite impressive](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hb2j3j/music_for_civvas_the_kaprediem_mixtape/). Huge props!
- New podcast? [I'll believe it when I see it (published)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hckslm/civtalk_podcast/). Hopefully, it'll be the best one since BOX Talk

### Memes

- [cat meme do be catting, i wonder what kind of cat estalia is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hajmjk/evils_estalias/)
- [Oh so, we're calling it "Cuddling" now, not entity cramming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hb7arw/the_exyrian_cuddling/)
- Is [this an Ukai post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hcksp5/newfriends_pearled_by_khallekdonia_the/)
- I think the auctions for [DICK and DOGE are memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hf3pa3/auction_of_monument_bank_custom_sortcode_dick_and/) even though they technically are legitimate auctions.
- Average [civ meme moment](https://i.imgur.com/aB4lgJT.png)

### Non-Civ Content

- I am so happy [Jet Lag is back!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHjkSKQSzv4)
- Music corner has some very... weird ones this week:
  - TwoSet Violin may be leaving, but they are ending off with six K-Pop pieces inspired by Classical Composers. Their second, [Mozart's Papa Wolfgang Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnwoNdq3hGY), I keep repeating -- maybe it's the Psy memes in me
  - The Turkish March motif then reminds me [of this Siivagunner Deltarune rip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqQuqqcL_-U)
  - And then I literally find this week that someone made a remix of it for Beethoven's [Moonlight Sonata, Mvmt. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbPbBjpuRw)
  - [I've seen this Idiot Box album circulating around various discords and I do like the low-bit aesthetic](https://secretterminal.bandcamp.com/album/idiot-box) of this
- Wow, [here's my favorite Connections influencer, Hank Green on his comments of the awful image connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZLkLChljE)
- [...that's not entirely accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L02gl9YoSFg)
- ChrisChrispie [proposes the *second* Civ-wide sports related thing, a fantasy football league for next year](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1hadu7q/civ_dynasty_or_redraft_fantasy_football_league/)... although it might be better to do perfect playoff bracket prediction for this postseason!
  - As a side note I miss [Meracydia's Pickems](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/162fh7k/announcing_the_meracydian_nfl_pickem_league/)

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/pNbVwXq.jpeg)

*A village amongst the snow in Alaska. [Yes, alright](https://media1.tenor.com/m/jipd6jDzP-QAAAAd/alaska.gif) but I think it looks pretty good. (cr: Not90)*

Last week, we had **40 responses.** A little low in general, but these questions were not that compelling this week.

### Ticket Effectiveness

![](https://i.imgur.com/V9yoRUX.png)

I asked this because I find this an odd progression with how Civ works in this modern age: modmail tickets evolved from Civ's usage of Reddit, and likewise we now have nation tickets from Civ's usage on Discord. Despite this though, a considerable amount of people dislike modmail tickets because of how non-communicative they are -- this generally goes the same for Discord in many cases.

I am pretty surprised that "Yes" is the most prevailing option here, essentially, but I think it may not have been a great question. How many people are just annoyed with how tickets work, you know?

### Newsmagazine Features

While there's a lot of the framework of the new format set in stone, I did want to see what I've been missing from the plan:

> You to not scare the life out of us, that youre gonna stop with the newsletter stuff

Oopsie (but I am and moving monthly)

> Player spotlights / interviews

This was the top most requested item entirely. I do remember that [Lodish did these player spotlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/civwiki/comments/sna9gg/the_bgbba_interview/) back in the day, and I definitely think a return would be very cool -- however I am personally not amazing at interviewing, and transcribing it would generally be a pain with or without AI. Still, I would definitely want to find a way to integrate that! I think in nature I try not to focus on individual players in newsletters, but it might be worth it to put a spotlight on some people who are mainstays and make the game as it is.

> I wonder if a cartoonist would be possible? Even just like a civballs comic in each magazine could be cute

Another excellent idea. Civball comics are pretty sparing though, and even Stoomer has had trouble getting people motivated for a map of the world this year. How will I even be able to get a comic out monthly here?

> Maybe individual nation/subnation spotlights going over history, culture, political systems, etc? Getting into the server it’s hard to get a feel for the many different kinds of playstyles and communities that exist here, and the newsletter’s always been good at breaking into that, but a more focused approach especially on communities like Prussia or Icarus that are storied in their own right but within larger nations could be enlightening even for older players

Featured articles sort of fill the niche there, but a recurring intro Travel Guide kind of thing would be pretty cool to see.

> Opinion pieces. I want to know what you think of certain situations as well

I'm so detached from Civ lately that I personally wouldn't write opinion pieces, but I know so many others would line up at the door for this. **If you're interesting in filling in or writing about any of the above, feel free to message me `@specificlanguage` on Discord!**

## Penultimate Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/neLK2ru.png)

*Players at the Exilus Exorcists vs. the Icenian Isopods (cr: RedDevel)*

Thanks for reading this week's newsletter!

Just a note that while this is the second-to-last edition of the weekly newsletter, **I will most likely publish the next week's newsletter on Tuesday** rather than Monday -- simply because I'll be travelling halfway around the world next week, which will prevent me from publishing at the normal time corresponding in Pacific Time.

I didn't have any help with this newsletter (which will probably the best last one I don't get help on!). If you'd like to help me in the future, give me a shout at `@specificlanguage` on Discord.

I'm looking for anyone who's willing to write regularly each month -- whether it's columns, interviews, or journalism, as long as you have something to the table, I'm happy to hear you out!

Thanks, and until next week...
