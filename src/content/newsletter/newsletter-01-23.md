Good morning and happy Monday from good 'ol New England.

Not much happened this midweek but as I'm writing this I'm bracing for the weekend news rush, as usual. Hopefully we're not going to see something extremely terrible like a war happening, right?!

## Featured

This week's featured picture is Nara's temples in their main city. I actually took this picture myself this last weekend while going around Alenarith, and Earyx has said "i thought this was a irl pic", so if that has merit to either my photography or their commitment to building sublime Imperial Japanese architecture, then we'll both take that compliment!

### Featured Article

[**Nro'meagh**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Nro'meagh) was a clan-based society on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic); while commonly referred to as a country as a whole, the area was mainly held by several clans acting as their own sovereign countries. Of the many factions in the region, the primary players were Alexandria, an anarchic build city similar to [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivClassic_2.0)), Jevoghnya, the oldest and most historically significant region where the conlang of Nro'meagh was born, and Caesar's Legion, a Roman-roleplay clan similar to the [Fallout clan of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas), focused on conquering the entire region.

Throughout its lifespan, these clans were engaged in several alliances and wars. Several clans also maintained alliances with nations uninvolved with the region, such as [Vinland](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Vinland) and [Adina](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Adina). In 2020, several major conflicts occurred, with two major clans, Alexandria and Threkeld, squaring off in February 2020. During April 2020, Caesar's Legion also achieved their goal of conquering the entire region, however were overthrown by a coalition of clans led by [Topher3001](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Topher3001) the following month. Today, some Nro'meagh players currently play in today's [Imperial Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Imperial_Federation).

### Around CivMC

#### Wartorn Northwest

- Icenia has elected MrJeremyFisher to replace Orinnari in the Icenian council, after Orinnari resigned.
- However, in brighter news, the Icenia rail station has been linked up *AND* is now OneDest compatible, at least according to Gjum.
- Warmia, a small newfriend territory, [has gained autonomy within Kallos.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10hd9y5/warmia_officially_got_autonomy/)
- Also remember that war declared between Valyria and Temporal Isles? At the moment, the war has come to a standstill, with Temporal Isles demanding Valyria to reinstate their portal permissions.
- Binchymonkey [trespassed on Icenia and gave everyone a "good laugh" after quite literally suicide bombing on the island.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10iagwc/icenian_militia/)

#### Quite Literally Everything Else
- Lambat [closed off their nether portal to all visitors.](https://discord.com/channels/810436686021394492/812258748285845525/1066391503301267466) This came after EVDan had been mining around the country's portal without gaining express permission, and [have placed further restrictions around his own use of the portal.](https://discord.com/channels/810436686021394492/810436686021394496/1066408886313160794)
- Additionally, the University of Lambat's public library has tragically burned down, however [it has recently been rebuilt](https://discord.com/channels/810436686021394492/812258748285845525/1065613812792823848) and looks really good.
- [Pavia has decided to leave the Four Continent Concordat](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/981672143978901524/1066057855486132224), following Venne's departure from the alliance last month. The reason stated however, is that the Crown Prince wished to renegotiate their treaty settlement with the Imperial Federation, being the primary power in the alliance.
  - This means that the Imperial Federation and Pridelands are the only countries left in the alliance; as the two are effectively the same country the FCC essentially no longer is in effect.
- You may have also noticed a crudely made "logistics rail" around Pavia, as it marks the start and creation of a city wall surrounding Pavia. It's currently in progress and [being built by ArtificialDriver and Gobblin.](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/971089862931386409/1066022095999467570) *Crossposted from the Desk of Domi.*
- Yoahtl met on Saturday for another [great migration of pigeons to Iria](https://discord.com/channels/278045721742147586/421600713898983424/1066476230838341724).
- IF citizen Coolchacha97 won the first-ever Godhaven senator election, narrowly beating out newfriend competitor foehammermele, after Jahlf was recently elected chancellor of the Imperial Federation.
- [Hg_80 discovered that Raeders had placed snitches in Otonabee.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10eo801/hostile_intentions/)
- The Distant Horizons project [has completed its first pole-to-pole expedition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10e45yo/the_first_pole_to_pole_piston_machine_flight_in/), beginning their effort to map the entire server. At the time of writing I believe they've completed two additional expeditions.
- [The Newfriend Development Initiative has been created, with offices in Kallos and Warmia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10gmxx3/announcing_the_newfriend_defense_network/) They're planning to assist newfriends to prevent them from jumping into large holes they're not supposed to.
- Several democratic nations have come together [to create the "Democratic Nations Forum", a place for those nations to come together to maintain and establish greater ties with each other.](https://discord.gg/phTFAV9rJE)

### Other Server News

- CivReign clarified its rules, [now directing people to an upgraded rulebook.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/962079741391802368/1066115779440943164/Copy_of_CivReign_Rule_Book.pdf)
- Additionally, [CivReign moderators announced that a certain peeing dog would be met with the same scrutiny as when posted on CivMC](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1066441920735350825), so take that as you will.
- [Several nations have begun advertising for CivReign](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/1059930337892904981) as the launch approaches this Friday.
  - One interesting thing, however is that [SpeedyJustice advertised a Mount Augusta successor in CivReign](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/1064994368609591427), without the backing of any current or former Augustans. It's been since rebranded to Petoria, so I guess he's doing a Family Guy RP now.

## The Fun Stuff

*Pavia's shipyard, but a different view than I usually give! Taken by RektTangle.*

### Builds

- [Pavia's Shipyard is really cool, and it's taken by Rekt, another one of his impressive renders](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/971089862931386409/1066022095999467570), fun fact it's in 8K!
- [Lambat's new library is actually like a good university library](https://discord.com/channels/810436686021394492/812258748285845525/1065613812792823848)
- I went around the Southeast last weekend taking pictures of whatever, and had several choice pics of [Mount Augusta](https://i.imgur.com/JnOoxAJ.jpg), [Nara](https://i.imgur.com/sgUWotl.jpg), [the Topher Tower](https://i.imgur.com/BeBSYOP.jpg) in Doom City, [Cortesia Del Mar](https://i.imgur.com/CsJXomz.jpg), [Ila'Kyavul](https://i.imgur.com/g1hez8Z.jpg), and [Lusitania](https://i.imgur.com/3mRK9IV.jpg)
- [The Distant Horizons project has once again pulled out another amazing image of the Alenarith Ice Shelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10if3ci/the_vast_rugged_wilderness_of_the_alenarith_ice/)

### Multimedia Projects

- [Winterbourne has been doing some touring](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10hcezl/lock_up_your_children_bourne_angels_planning/), is it like Criss Angel but Winterbourne? /s
- [Low key the Icenia rap kinda slaps, the flow is really good](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10dtqgw/downtown_icenia_a_kallos_diss_track/), incredible work from PercJackson
- [Pavia's flag map art is looking sweet](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/981672143978901524/1066744548040114186), although it's going to be sad when you change the flag when the rat king is no longer in power

### Memes

- [Tactical Hell, more like pretentious](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10hkiyi/tactical_hell/)
- Ah yes, [Iceboat png rescuing minecraft horse that can definitely swim](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10i3uhr/winterbourne_royal_national_lifeboat_makes_heroic/)
- Well, I guess it is technically news but [Blob wins the City of England elections by a "landslide"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10h23ed/january_23_judicial_elections_in_city_of_england/)
- [sorry for getting pearled guys, it was an RI impulse](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10ewkjt/the_sight_of_walkers_activates_notable_horse/)

### Economics & Ads

*Starting in February, this section will be transitioning to paid advertisements. More details at the bottom of the newsletter!*

- [The diamond exchange in Pavia saw a spike late in the week, with the price heading back up to 14 after a full week hanging around 13i/d.](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/1030074737734455298/1066411825169702912)
- A ["small debate" about XP prices occurred in the Mount Augusta discord](https://discord.com/channels/948288144384589865/985194294321233980/1066473273094844506) mostly because Icenia is selling XP for 3d/block while Yoahtl is starting to sell for 2d/block. Boy, do i love business!

### Metagame Highlights

- I was alerted that a certain Reiko, from a certain 4chan board, was interviewed by TomDark on YouTube this past week. I'm not going to link it directly, but for those curious, just look it up yourself. It's not even worth looking up, watching 5 seconds of it just made me want to cringe.
- [GTAIV and Maester Milipede have recreated their billboards typeface previously seen on older iterations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/10ha70e/billboards_are_back/)

## Clogger-ing Cry for Help

### The New Ad System

So, you're wondering about the new advertisements system. I'll set up a form included in next week's newsletter for an preferred ad-read, and price.

- For CivMC vendors, I'm setting the initial price at **15d/week per ad.** (You only get one ad in the newsletter however.)
  - That being said, you can order up to four weeks in advance (60d upfront), and I reserve the right to change the price of the ads depending on how easy/hard it currently is to get diamonds. Then you'll use a dropchest for payment.
  - I've set the price this low as to allow potential merchants coming into the scene to be able to buy ads for at least a week, just to give them a spotlight.
  - The editorial process might reflect differently, but we'll see!
- For CivReign folks, ads are going to be using the same basis that's been used before for the first couple of months so the economy gets started and then I may start charging.

One thing that will be slightly different however, is that you'll also receive a small discount on either server's ads if you [contribute a featured article to the newsletter,](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9) but the featured article cannot be about your business (sorry Monument Group). Help contribute information for public good, and you get a slight discount! Isn't that neat?

### The Normal Cry for Help

Now there are also people who have asked about a patreon or crowdfunding -- I'm still considering that right now, and, I must note, since very little of this newsletter has any money costs, a good majority of this will be pumped back into personal projects that have completely nothing to do with Civ or this newsletter.

To also further save costs, I'm undergoing a migration process away from AWS later this week, so the newsletter will be down for (hopefully less than hour) midweek.

That being said, if you do want to contribute, at least contribute your time by doing the possible potential things:

- **Writing a featured article!** There's no real formula for this, but it should give a brief overview of a thing that happened in Civ anytime in the past. Take a look at either [past featured articles](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivWiki:Featured), or [the counterpart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Today%27s_featured_article/January_2022). Feel free to research!
- **Writing an op-ed or opinion item:** [I really like this PDF from Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/hks-communications-program/files/new_seglin_how_to_write_an_oped_1_25_17_7.pdf) but the real thing is that this should not be a long essay and should be short and focused.

If you'd like to write something to show up on the newsletter, contact me and we can figure out the best writing for you!

Ok, that was a lot. Sorry about that. Finally, as always...
