Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

It's once again the Monday before Thanksgiving which feels much earlier than I usually feel it comes. I've given myself a bit of grace the past couple of weeks and hopefully will be a bit better on working on things that might be a little more productive. Civ can be a good distraction

## Featured

This week's featured image is Pacem's main square. I've mentioned it a few times in the newsletter before, but I think this is the first time I've seen the area very built out, and I'm super excited to see what's in store for them. Going back to that '20s style architecture from before that's Pacem's bread and butter, it's amazing to see them start working on the city they've promised for more than year now. Really great to see, and I can't wait to see it built out a lot more.

### Featured Article

**[Realistic Biomes](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Realistic_Biomes)** is a plugin commonly found on Civ servers to adjust crop growth times. Used normally to balance [experience production](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Enchanting), Realistic Biomes adjusts crop growth and breeding to be dependent on biomes, and light visibility, as well as adjust crop growth times to take hours or days for a crop to be fully harvestable. Optimal growth times usually are around three to eight hours, but are lower in less corresponding biomes, for example, potatoes grow well in winter-themed biomes, like taigas or tundras, but do not grow in hot biomes, like deserts or jungles.

Originally debuting on [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft), it became a mainstay of Civ servers to this day, as it slowed player progression down to prevent quick enchantments. Clay can be used to speed up growth times to up to 33%, and glowstone or lamp-like blocks can be used to simulate greenhouse-environments underground. Crop growth is also persistent, meaning that it will continue to grow while chunks are unloaded. Development on the plugin continues to this day and has been used on every mainline Civ server since Civcraft.

### Thinner Ice

Last week, as many readers are probably aware, Icenian Senate Speaker [Quanton_Biscuit posted accusations of Gang Shi targeting Icenia for frivolous purposes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17u0xqo/gang_shis_drama_factory/) Gang Shi leader [Gwua posted a rebuttal within a few hours](https://reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17u6q9m/icenias_delusion_factory/), which I now have the pleasure to summarize (after it was thankfully posted after the news cutoff the previous week)

- Gwua explained that PhysicsGamer was not involved and [they were merely distracted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bas2uVekJE) by his presence (which, yes that's what happened), but criticized that PhysicsGamer's actions were being representative of Gang Shi. Gwua claims they weren't as [PhysicsGamer was deliberately doing so to be mercy banned.](https://imgur.com/a/6NivtHm)
- In terms of SpeedyJustice's pearling, Gwua claims that the reason was leverage, but also [revenge for obbybombing an ice road, mentioned as one of the previous posts](https://imgur.com/9uCQJPy), justifying that their discovery of the obbybomb on sudden notice allowed them to pearl SpeedyJustice.
- Finally, in response to them blowing up Icenian building, they responded with a very lame "Lol. Reinforce your shit."

Gang Shi claims they are doing this out of self-defense and protecting their interests, claiming "We have not routinely lied, bullied, or attacked anyone. What we have done is routinely defended our interests and our friends against opposition such as yourself."

Most users in the comments were not very appreciative of this response, mainly due to the [lack of original proof of the claims](https://reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17u6q9m/icenias_delusion_factory/k91qy8t/), (not even joking, *every* link in the above section was from its predecessor) and [just general dismissive language from in the post and comments.](https://reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17u6q9m/icenias_delusion_factory/k922w6r/)

General Icenia and Gang Shi conflicts this week eventually resulted in a subreddit PvP war for public relations, mostly triggered by memes in poor taste. I won't cover them too much because, they're not only not funny, but come on, it's really just the same things being yelled over and over again.

### Happenings Around Civ

- [Nara announced a new city, built last weekend around a large clock tower they built a few months ago, named Orakuru](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17v23uh/nara_is_expanding_its_second_city_beyond_its/).
- [Florence separated from Kar-Kazdun which went inactive](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17v1444/florence_becomes_its_own_nation/) -- although that does mean Dark is now running another nation after Lambeau, which is also inactive
- [Columbia reestablished their claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17x66nk/columbia_3_consciousness_grid_jubilee/), as they claim areas west of the former Rhode Island territory.
- [Icenia and Nara signed a friendship agreement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17yopj3/icenianara_friendship_pact/), agreeing upon non-aggression, sharing bountied persons, and international cooperation.
- The [Monument Bank gave an update on their bot's rewrite](https://i.imgur.com/Kflv0Nk.png), and hint at future updates for the bank in the future.
- [Mat_Potato_King won reelection handily as Chancellor within the Imperial Federation](https://i.imgur.com/2hlPP2Q.png), with Regency being elected as the citizen's judge.
- Although an informal announcement, Mat_Potato_King also announced that [the Imperial Federation would annex Landshut and Withervale near Otonabee.](https://i.imgur.com/PvA8ilI.png)
- [Gang Shi announced the opening of their capital city, Blacklight for January 20, 2024.](https://i.imgur.com/PpIsoJ4.png)
- [Estalia's Phoenix Bird at Suramir Market in 0,0 is missing...](https://i.imgur.com/WYtsQ6F.png) contact any Estalian if you find anything!

### Metagame Highlights

- [jbblocker criticized on Reddit about people downvoting art from Butter_villager and iinkuu](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17uwnww/can_we_please_stop/). Not sure why this is a debate, but if someone really dislikes at least well made art, something's wrong.
- Gjum [created a calculator on his civmc.tk website to navigate the complicated interest structure of the Monument Bank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17ug5fe/interest_calculator_for_monument_bank/)
- Jaydon [compiles some statistics to see who's been playing on CivMC the most](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/17vqyjd/civmc_playtime_analytics/), and then shaming those who play for too long. Would you be surprised I'm actually not even in the top 500?
- [Distant Horizons released a new video for their upcoming 2.0 release, which includes an API.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxQdbtjGEsc) Somewhere in Germany, Gjum sprinted into action as he began to write a new Horizons sync client.
- ItzHoover revamped his Aeros discord into a Civ Book Club where players can talk about player-written books on Civ. It's like the Maester Alliance lite. [Join here.](https://discord.gg/b45Kn8YU)

Ah, you know, the usual.

### Poll of the Week

This week we only had 16 responses, a new low. What the hell is going on?

The first question was "Are you participating in the CivWiki competition?"

![](https://i.imgur.com/PBK6XXK.png)

There's not much to say but if you want free diamonds, go and edit CivWiki. I know there's some issues right now with images, but I highly encourage you to work on something for the benefit of the server and documentation of history for future generations of newfriends to come. **I swear, I don't advertise CivWiki well, but goddammit, I want it to be good, so you gotta do your editing as much as I have to do it, too!**

The second question was "What poll questions would you like to see?" I only got one, which isn't worth asking about, so it's not worth talking about it too much. Maybe a better open response question will trigger some people?

#### The Actual Poll

<ColoredBlock color="bg-sky-200" darkColor="dark:bg-sky-950">
    <Poll client:load submitURL={"/newsletter-11-20"} questions={
        [

                question: "Are you travelling for thanksgiving this holiday?",
                options: [
                    "Yes",
                    "No",
                    "I don't celebrate Thanksgiving",
                ],
                type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,
                useOther: false,

            },
            {
                questionID: "art",
                question: "Do you enjoy seeing art on the subreddit?",
                options: [
                    "Yes, I like seeing imaginative art",
                    "Yes, but I'd like to see more varied art",
                    "Yes, but people don't need to post on the subreddit to not downvote it",
                    "No, but I appreciate the effort, even it may not fit",
                    "No, because they're Gang Shi",
                    "No, I don't like having art on the subreddit",
                ],
                type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,
                useOther: false,
                required: false
            },
            {
                questionID: "whynotart",
                question: "If you answered no (or a variation of no) to the previous question, would you like to elaborate why?",
                type: QuestionType.ShortResponse,
                useOther: false,

## Bawk-Bawk Cry for Help

*DesertMelons' version of continents of the Map of the World.*

Of course, this is the last newsletter before we head into the Thanksgiving season, and I still want to thank everyone for reading, especially you all for allowing me to take occasional breaks on the newsletter when I desperately need to. We're heading to the end of the year and I know I haven't done much, and there's still a lot to do, but I know I can do it.

Thanks to...oh wait I was the only one writing the newsletter this week, oh well. Well, dear reader, thanks for reading it anyways. Always worth liking that someone reads my content.

If you're in the US and celebrating Thanksgiving on Thursday, please spend this time with family, friends, or both, and don't come into Civ. It's one of the few times you probably will be able to get together to help. I certainly won't log in or look at the subreddit. If you're not celebrating Thanksgiving, take a minute to say thanks to your close ones, because they'll always appreciate it.

Thanks one last time for reading this newsletter and supporting me for all this time, one of the few constants in my life for the past year and a half (which is honestly shocking to say). In other words...
