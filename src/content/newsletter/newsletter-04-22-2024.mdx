Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

Things are heating up, for better or for worse, so that's pretty exciting for Civ! Maybe not for everyone, but I truly hope that things are turning for the better in terms of finding joy on Civ. It is a struggle and I really do understand that in a very serious sense. But even I've found some renewed interest in Civ recently, which I think it's really just dipping into something novel that I haven't done in a while.

Of course, I can't say that for everyone, but there's a Civ project (although, I guess there's a couple) that I'm working on, so hopefully I can show them very soon. Are we ready for the news?

For this week's featured image, it's a familiar place now left behind -- the Maester's Assembly in Mount Augusta. Throughout the trek to the top of the titular mountain, where the Maesters have taken their refuge, tales and history of the original Maesters are present and continue to tell their history as they climb their way up the mountain. As the country now migrates somewhere else, it's a shame that this great structure -- and their books -- will remain here for the time being.

### Featured Article

**[VintageCiv](https://civwiki.org/wiki/VintageCiv)** is a Civ server based in Vintage Story. It is notable for being one of the few Civ servers to be in a game that is not Minecraft. Although it itself a derivation and expansion of [AbjectPovertyCraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/AbjectPovertyCraft), another Civ server based in Vintage Story that introduced their version of [ExilePearl](https://civwiki.org/wiki/ExilePearl), VintageCiv expanded upon the concept significantly in scope. It introduced [Citadel](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Citadel)-like reinforcements and the concept of [Snitches](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Snitch) into the game, both of which would [eventually be adopted into the main game itself](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php?title=Block_reinforcement).

The initial iteration of VintageCiv launched in early 2022, during a break between [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) and [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC)'s release, which was praised for its features had mixed reception. Its second and longest iteration so far, 2.0, was introduced in May 2022 and saw more emergent gameplay than its prior iteration. Although its admins have announced they would be working on a third iteration in 2024, no progress or release date have been announced as of yet.

## The News

### Around the Server

- [Pavia, Griffin and Amboise announced the formation of the Lyrean Commonwealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c5lb84/formation_of_the_lyrean_commonwealth/).
  - Although the territory of the three nations remain unchanged, they announced that a central council and Emperor (currently Paagf) would deal with land, foreign affairs, shared infrastructure, etc.
  - While not explicitly stated, Pavia's CUBs, or friendship pacts are carried forward along with the NAP they have with Icenia.
  - Basically, the TL;DR is that this is a European Union of sorts for the three Lyrean nations.
- The [Temporal Empire was raided with the attempt of pursuing PhysicsGamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c6ra90/a_call_for_reason_in_the_face_of_hatred/) this past week.
  - Citing [political grievances within CivMC general chat](https://i.imgur.com/NU7iJBN.png), realmichael and Graciepie (for long time Civ players, you may know the latter as Zachtack) raided [Temporal's tree farm](https://preview.redd.it/9ie9dwq855vc1.png) and spider grinder while attempting to pursue PhysicsGamer in game.
  - Their stated reason for pursuing him were ["crimes against Savaguard"](https://preview.redd.it/p2c3wc3w55vc1.png), although no specific crimes have been admitted.
  - Physics then called upon Graciepie's pearl, and realmichael's pearl as well.
  - Savaguard [currently has Graciepie barred from logging in for a week, and has him serving one month in the country for his actions.](https://i.imgur.com/mUthUkD.png) Further punishments are still to be negotiated with PhysicsGamer.
- SlothInASuit [announced the establishment of the Common Fleet Alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c9gt37/land_claims_post/), intended to be a state of Exyria, despite the deceptive name.
  - It's mostly taking over inactive parts of Iria to its north that have been mostly unused, although, I personally believe it's a travesty that the land will only be used for [building airships with a huge amount of jungle that could be used for literally anything else](https://i.imgur.com/NnTTUZ6.png)
- JPM_Stalin [announced the establishment of the Despotate of Iaumea](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c94196/the_despotate_of_iaumea_has_been_established/), intended to be a successor state to continue developing Santiago in former Cortesia Del Mar.
- I only found out DockerImage [has been released very unceremoniously in a meme thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c984km/the_founding_of_kallumbia/l0jr1we/), and I can't believe I'm saying this, but let's hope he doesn't cause a major war this time
- SPQR [had their anniversary celebration this past weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c9ptl9/spqr_anniversary_celebration/), celebrating 11 years of Civ with tons of games, an auction, and more! I have to keep it on my calendar for next year...
- Speaking of combat, [matt4fun9 was "set to be sacrificed" in Yoahtl's Olympic Arena, a 2v1 to "keep the peace"](https://i.imgur.com/E7CHHsw.png), but [actually won the combat](https://i.imgur.com/5Px6958.png), so I guess no peace...
- [Baile has announced a lottery for anybody to participate in](https://i.imgur.com/IYu4FCV.png), the more diamonds that get entered will win bigger prizes.
  - As a result, [Baile clarified that access to the city needs access from other officials](https://i.imgur.com/sGUjANS.png), which would be needed to buy tickets.
  - [Baile has also offered a bounty for boyinadress619](https://i.imgur.com/ZsDrYiS.png) for raiding Psyox's chests -- any help would be appreciated.
- [Blatlas announced that MtFuji would be taking over their position within the Naran government.](https://i.imgur.com/79sKGV9.png)
- [A wither terrorized Shockton on Saturday and really spooked everyone there.](https://i.imgur.com/vTQAk5M.png) By Sunday however, it was defeated and a travel advisory was removed.

### Metagame Highlights

- CivMC makes a minor change that [removes Schematica from the list of allowed mods, replacing with Litematica.](https://i.imgur.com/SYkBbFp.png) This does nothing but updates the allowed schematic to a more recent and widely used version.
- As CivRush is developing its third iteration, [it opened its server last weekend and allowed players to continue exploring its first iteration map.](https://i.imgur.com/vvKUSOS.png)
- [ForgedTK sends out a nation census, asking people who are currently citizens of each nation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c4o2io/civmc_nation_census/) and there's a huge response from most currently active nations -- for data entrepeneurs, this might be fun to extract some data about players from!


## The Fun Stuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/huvjPQA.png)

### Builds

- [SneedChungus has built a big, giant tree](https://i.imgur.com/cNeeABs.png) and it's really cool, reminds me of the banyan trees in Hawaii
- [Mount Notch is real, and it's found, what the hell](https://i.imgur.com/FF3MepS.png)
- [Shockton's fishing hut is a great representation of a build with an odd color palette done really well](https://i.imgur.com/6Fu2BUQ.png)
- [I wish I could post more images of Griffin but I guess this one image album of Isernia Castle will have to do](https://i.imgur.com/10YeVgX.png)
- Sure, the builds look a bit weird but I do have to say, [Withervale has some good builds on the beach that are starting to look great](https://i.imgur.com/OVCwdTb.png)

### Cool Content

- VilyanZ is doing an interesting idea -- [making tectonic plate maps for CivMC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c4mk8s/civmc_tectonic_plates_map_plus_some_fault_lines/) Honestly, pretty reasonably made and they're pretty well done.
- Of course, though he was hard at work making [the amazingly complicated Venn Diagram of alliances for this month](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c5pn54/alliance_chart_april_2024_patch_notes_col_got/) after the Lyrean Community made everything crazy
  - [This is pretty much the when many realized that BUILD has disbanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c5pn54/alliance_chart_april_2024_patch_notes_col_got/kzvrlq7/), although most of the agreements remain. Sorry to put news down here.
- And of course, [don't forget the over-complicated claims maps for this month too from TheJmqn!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c6lh6i/civmc_unofficial_map_26_ten_thousand_knives/)
- The [Lyrean Commonwealth came with some new maps which look cool, I like the colors specifically](https://i.imgur.com/0WhXAfp.png)
- Lodish hasn't really mentioned this a lot, [he's made several different pins and emblems for Civ nations in Vintage Story!](https://mods.vintagestory.at/pins) It looks really cool and appreciate the work he's put into it. Would be fun to have nice little extras on Civ (even if technical limitations).

### Memes

- Somehow [this Pirates of the Carribbean clip actually works in this instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c984km/the_founding_of_kallumbia/)
- Somehow [this Harry Potter clip works slightly less in this instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c7otn0/temporal_has_return_to_war_civ_shitpost/)
- [Ocean's Eleven vibe](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c4ty2v/winterbourne_royal_family_appreciation_post/)
- [Admin Island will only be a dream, never a reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c9bf5q/what_is_admin_island/)
- [Whoa the resolution on this is crusty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sADuace3agk)
- I know this is just [a Los Pollos Hermanos meme but the issue with me is that while this animation is fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c9v0fz/empops_pet_peeves_civmc_animation/), I think I expected more...
- Haha, yes, [there are totally no ASN missiles here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1c9i73s/leaked_asn_documents_classified/)

### Non-Civ Content

- A very serious note though, I've started getting motion sickness from playing a lot of games recently. Don't worry, [I touch enough grass in my daily life so that's not really that much of an issue](https://i.imgur.com/6Xnh5Ke.png), but it might be that Balatro's screenshaking is messing with my brain. I honestly don't know...
- Oh yes, I'm also playing Balatro these days, although I haven't gotten past Ante 10 because I don't know how to find good jokers! When I have a crazy run to show I will absolutely get throw in here.
- The [baseball app I'm making is coming along and I *really* want to be on track to release it this coming week](https://i.imgur.com/QWqFYpn.png). We'll see if I can though!
- Otherwise, among things I am hoping or in progress to watch -- Fallout, Taylor Swift's new album, the new season of Game Changer, you know.

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/vYcLmW2.png)

*Winterbourne Harbour, and its reflection in the sea. (cr: Princess Bow)*

Last week we had **65 responses** to our three questions.

Get ready for a long explanation because what I gave you were some really heated questions.

### World Wonders, Part 1

Our first question was part of the ongoing **World Wonders polls**, about which ones you would consider world wonders!

![](https://i.imgur.com/XqViKEe.png)

Now there were a *lot of* people that didn't understand how I was conducting this. To not overwhelm you with too many choices, the **wonder selection is being done, tournament style**, so over the course of several newsletters, you'll be seeing nearly everything that was submitted, along with some of my own additions that I also consider to be pretty good.

The seeding wasn't finalized at the time when I made this, but it is now -- these four were some interesting picks I saw that deserved some praise, and ones that weren't in Pavia. *The ones with the most votes overall (not by seeding) will be selected to proceed to the next round until we can narrow things down to a decent list.* You can, of course, pick as many as you want.

I might recirculate *Volterra City*, as it was slightly ambiguous of whether it was referring to Shockton or Volterra Prime. I'll keep you all updated of the count over time.

---

### Chore or Enjoyment?

Our second question was about whether **Civ feels like a chore or something enjoyable.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/WEWApvQ.png)

I only ask this question now as quite recently as a game that I previously really enjoyed, *Hearthstone*, have made a change to their reward system that makes [games feel more like a chore for the quests than something I do for the fun of playing the game.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1c7hmsf/hearthstones_10th_anniversary_big_brain_decisions/)

I kind of wanted to see how it felt for a game like Civ, where the grind is ever present and the game less enjoyable (arguably). Interesting to see that many people sort of view this as a chore but somehow still enjoy this game. Its biggest strength is undoubtedly its player-driven economy and civlization building but I think the true detriment is twofold: botting and history combined with PvP aspects, and I think that's what many people have been starting to feel it might be a chore.

But hey, that's just a theory!

---

### Other Game Mechanics in Civ

The final question had to do with asking **what game mechanics from other games they'd like to bring into Civ.** Besides the obvious "add gun" and more recent "cannibalism" memes...

>Stardew Valley

was the largest game-specific response. I find this very interesting, since it does have a farming and shop system, but its laid back environment and continued opportunities to explore make it a honestly pretty good thing to live up to on Civ. I think we'd all aspire to be at least a bit more relaxed.

>Dungeons/PvP realms/shards

This is something that I've seen done in other Minecraft servers; one fun idea has been those prison servers, but you could bring resources from the prison to your survival area.

I do think this would be fun as a PvE limited event, like a roguelike with a special reward. However, this would be a *significant* hamper on development time, but it would be very interesting to battle big bosses for big prizes. Would definitely get the PvP scene involved.

>More events, distractions, etc.

Speaking of which, events were a very common theme in the responses. Just things to excite the playerbase. Some ideas included "clue scrolls from Runescape", "CivTCG", or "anything at the expense of people's ingame livelihoods", which I wouldn't condone.

Now, hot take, but while events are a nice side effect, I don't think they are the end all, be all solution. Overwatch did regular events but didn't really do much to excite the playerbase past the first year. The creativity of the events help, but relying on events as a crutch will make people just more bored of events in the future.

>Skill trees, tech tree advancement, etc.

For Civ veterans, you may know that Civcraft 3.0 had a planned (albeit extremely underbaked) skill tree plugin called SkilUp. Of course, this idea is so dead in the water, you may as well call it the Titanic.

This player suggested kind of Sid Meier's Civ VI-like research/civic system, but it might be more interesting to see a system like the jokers in Balatro. Having some sort of soft-tech enhancement way to focus into specific niches, like democratic cities have a bonus that increases factory yields by a small amount by however many people are in its territory but lowers crop yields by the same amount, could be an interesting idea... but I'm not a game designer.

Although, I don't think this is possible without a city core like mechanic.

>Backpacks

Of course, we know this is something that people have wanted for a while. I think it's only a matter of time until Shulker Boxes get on live, but it would help massively for builders and would cause a huge economic shock. That being said, probably needs to have a compacted stack restriction.

>PvP with less stakes

There are two much longer responses associated with this particular idea, however the crux of the issue is that there are many people that WANT to PvP, but are restricted by the diplomacy you see in Civ. People are extremely adverse in going to war. Somehow finding a way to lower the stakes a bit would enable a more interesting PvP mindset, where it's encouraged but not detrimental if raided.

Many people mention possible solutions as a "separate dimension", or "conflict management and de-escalation", but I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution in thie case.

This being said, pearls are a huge detriment to the PvP landscape in this case. Maybe we need to lock pearls behind a tech tree?

---

### Vote Now!

At this point, with me writing so much for this, I feel like the newsletter is just an excuse to talk about whatever's on the poll last week.

As a reminder, wonder questions are **approval voting**, so please vote whatever you think are wonders and top scorers will move onto the next round. You’ll be seeing nearly everything that was submitted, along with some of my own additions that I also consider to be pretty good. We're still on Round 1, and we will be for quite a while!

        useOther: false,
        required: false,
      },
    ]
  }/>
</ColoredBlock>

I will say, I am running out of questions to ask so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd like to hear them from you at `@specificlanguage` on discord.

I do kinda feel like 538, so I might publish a page with all polls in the future...

Thank you for reading this week's newsletter!

Unfortunately, I haven't made progress on a lot of things this week -- mostly busy and also trying to be patient at the same time. I hope you'll understand!

If you'd like to help support this newsletter through your own contributions (and as I'm leaving in roughly a few months, I need the help man!), I would highly appreciate your contributions to `@specificlanguage`!

Otherwise, I really appreciate all your support and as always...
