Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

I hope you guys all enjoyed the weekend antics, I certainly did (although, yes I did do [an average length newsletter for an april fools joke](/newsletter-04-01), thank you for asking). Despite everything going on I still had time to do homework, play board games, have brunch with friends and
also cook some food this past weekend.

Are we ready for the news?

This week's featured image is of Griffin's farms and aqueduct, located around their city of Adria. They've been building out considerably over the past few weeks, and these ruins are built eloquently in their style and it's started to look incredibly cool and give some great character to the country. I can't wait to see more of this, as per usual!

**[Otonabee](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Otonabee)**, a nation founded in March 2020 on [CivRealms 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRealms_2.0), was founded by a group of newfriends who constructed the city of Lynn in the desolate southwest region of the server. The city quickly became an important center for trade and transportation due to its proximity to the New World and their rail connections to [Olendor](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Olendor) and [SPQR](https://civwiki.org/wiki/SPQR_(CivRealms_2.0)).

Known for their lighthearted approach to diplomacy and politics, Otonabee quickly gained international recognition as talented builders and grinders. Prior to the [Second Hell War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Second_Hell_War), Otonabee and their larger neighbor [Varathia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Varathia) formed a union, creating the [Otona-Varathian Empire](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Otona-Varathian_Empire). Additionally, they claimed part of the [New World](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_World) as the Gallagher Territory and joined the [Far Seas Alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Far_Seas_Alliance).

Otonabee witnessed heavy fighting in both Hell Wars due to its location between the Hell and Ascension vaults, resulting in temporary occupation during the Second Hell War. Following the war, Otonabee and Varathia joined [Carbon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Carbon), which would pull both nations unwillingly into the Great War following the bombing of [CivCorp](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivCorp). Today, there is an iteration of Otonabee on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC). **[(Full article...)](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Otonabee)**

*This week's featured image is the city of Lynn on CivRealms.*

*The Bedford Commons, rendered of RektTangle. The only reason this isn't the top picture is that Pavia was featured more recently featured than Griffin by two weeks.*

- The big news this week was that [Warmia joined the Elysian Pact](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1253x67/warmia_joins_the_elysian_pact/).
    - The entry comes at a time when the alliance is "refocus[ing] on providing assistance and support to neighbours and members of the Elysian Pact for the betterment of our regional safety".
    - [Mark Anthony also supplemented](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1253x67/warmia_joins_the_elysian_pact/) that "the alliance will serve as a platform for cooperation and diplomacy", adding that the addition was "met with widespread support and optimism" for the global community.
    - Opinions outside the EP however, have been generally mixed as while some are happy that Warmia is getting support to be a global power, the Elysian Pact's efforts to redefine itself may be falling on deaf ears following the [Kallosian conflict.](/newsletter-02-13#greetings-to-another-war)
    - [The announcement has been continually memed upon in other discords becoming a copypasta.](https://discord.com/channels/558071874161082368/957806523785048104/1090502623808991263)
    - This does however mean that although Pavia signalled they would leave the Elysian Pact, the country is projected to remain.
- Warmia [apologized for claiming Nova Pszovia and a military base, as they said it provoked aggression in the region.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/127cq5t/i_apologise/)
- [PPIS, an organization headed by Warmia also disbanded.](https://discord.com/channels/1084812792613306518/1084840786253840507/1091259025145999381) I'm like 90% sure that it was an organization with Warmia, Leszneria and Wlazestan but I can't find any documentation of it everywhere, so I guess it happened...
- The Monument Group [has posted their shareholder letter for the first quarter in 2023, displaying a full doubling of share value in the past quarter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1290i5y/monument_group_quarterly_results_for_q1_2023_are/)
- Wilson and Gamertime from Gang Shi [were banned for literally using a radar mod](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518143769569394720/1089678570298818641/2023-03-26_15.49.16_2.png), continuing the admins' crackdown [following their changing map and radar mod policy.](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1091863860677464084)
- [Highroll has "quit" unlike SpeedyJustice below, and said he would reminisce about the "good 'ol days"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/125gg7l/goodbye/), except he's nowhere near semi-revered as SpeedyJustice, especially since he backed out for no fucking reason
- [Commonwealth had to fight off a wither attack this past weekend.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022839472007696524/1091938115343634523/2023-04-01_23.42.44.png)
    - [This actually linked to eleven other wither attacks](https://i.imgur.com/LGmXkSL.jpg) sent out by Hakr_ for April Fools Day, including some in Pavia, Icenia, and more.
- [Icarus has finished its parliamentary elections, electing Credix, sdorr, gruebleen, liquidstereo, and Drekamor to the parliament.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1252oft/results_of_the_presidential_and_parliamentary/)
- A little more context to Coolchacha's pearling last week:
    - [IF Chancellor ComradeSankara was pearled in Nara this past week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/125u296/the_federalist_papers_volume_2_issue_2_march_1529/) by CoolChaCha97, saying that "all I care about is ruining the IF". *Crossposted from the Federalist Papers.*
    - Fredhun eventually came from Dalgon to pearl CoolChaCha.
    - However, a legal battle is set to occur as the Imperial Federation is requesting extradition of CoolChaCha's pearl from Nara and Dalgon.
- [The Grand Western Imperial Line was completed from Petergrad to Grenada.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/127ij9g/the_grand_western_imperial_line_is_finished/)
- Elections in the Imperial Federation are also underway, with Potato_Duke set to run against ComradeSankara as a true reformer and opponent for the incumbent chancellor.
- [Icenia is currently holding their April elections; Forged has announced that he would not be running as a Senator this following month](https://discord.com/channels/558071874161082368/957806523785048104/1091388248191930478)
- Due to the April Fools joke going a little too far in Icenia, [ChrisChrispie took away Slushhi's admin permissions and banned Xcios. As a result, he and Bloom seceded from Icenia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/128uscf/bloom_secedes_from_icenia_not_april_fools/)
- banyough apologized for being inactive and [thanked everyone for making Lusitania great in the early days of this iteration.](https://discord.com/channels/422250595911729153/452975786727702538/1091028041557348422)

- Aeros [passed legislation that required all citizens to report all infrastructure that ran under the country.](https://discord.com/channels/947234837612359701/1056980630996533301/1090025138453491722)

## CivReign News

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/874786984835555338/1091774490171682906/2023-04-01_18.19.17.png?width=2685&height=1362)

*The Holy Isle of Brigantia, in Winter. Why are all my pictures that I get are winter themed, we're literally well into Spring by now...*

- CivReign continues their continued changelogs, introducing moonsteel pickaxes from steel anvils. [See their changelogs for full changes.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1091542233938923630)
    - However, there have been additional complaints from players regarding grind as [they have argued that admins haven't done enough to reduce grind for newer players getting into the server.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1092077085046100028)
    - They [have generally tried to address this with another fix](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1091904806320353383), increasing the rate of tree growth from 2 weeks to 3 days in peak season.
    - If it comes down to me, I haven't been able to dig up that much regarding literally anything on CivReign, mostly because nobody's really doing anything besides trying to overcome the grind, which is why this entire section is pretty short...
- [Courron has *finally* agreed on their flag's design](https://discord.com/channels/1063097554708996126/1063763532719603752/1091577104824553492), and have chosen a new flag inspired by their roots in Alexandria as well as a manta ray representing the great duke.
- Laurentia and Courron [have agreed upon the CLASS alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/1243854/class_courronlaurentia_alliance_for_security_and/), it commits the two countries to mutual security, defense and trade.
- [Laurentia has also announced the Merchants Association Organization, or the LMAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/12524it/announcing_the_laurentian_merchants_association/), intended to promote commerce and economic development in the region. It currently has many basic goods along with a limited selection of steel tools.
- [Brewyern has announced Axus and Brewbot as two new Ephors of the country](https://discord.com/channels/634421774905507872/1082782902154182726/1090028381720031343), who will lead the country while Hikoru is absent.


## Around Civ

- [SpeedyJustice has written a large monologue, and eventually decided to throw in the towel after playing on two different servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1247vqo/saul_gone_man/), while I will not necessarily miss him, I will at least say he did a really good fucking job roleplaying Saul Goodman
- [Amelorate has announced that they would continue toning down changes for Civ+](https://discord.com/channels/791021339674411059/791021340118220823/1091903327828201503); although it will continue to be alive as long as possible (a la CivRealms in its last days.)
    - However, [one last changelog from Amelorate was released on April 1st, and no it's not an April Fools joke](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/927878286783180851/1091901986460405841/4-1-23_changelog.png)
- Recent discussion in Praxis discord has surrounded [around Folia, a brand new plugin framework from the makers of Paper.](https://docs.papermc.io/folia/faq)
    - Most importantly, it's multithreaded, and is able to hold 300+ players without breaking (too much) of a sweat.
    - The thinking is that Civ plugins could be easily adapted to run on this software. It's still in early stages, but it's intriguing to say the least.
