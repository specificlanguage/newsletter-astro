Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

I hope everyone had a great and happy Thanksgiving weekend, only a couple days to go until the holiday season! Unfortunately didn't get as much done as I wished, mostly because my Civ commitments got overriden by other, more pressing issues but we're still grinding on the newsletter here regardless.

Ready for the news?

This week's featured image is of Altepetl, taken by Ara. The jewel of the jungle in my own words, rapid development has been happening here the past few weeks, including the walls you see now reminescent of [New Yoahtl City](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Yoahtl_City) on Civclassic, with way more high-rises than when I last saw the city several weeks ago. The country's economic development is also in full swing, with the Great Overland Railway now effectively stretching from Katipan in Lambat all the way down the Lusitania's main rail station, stopping by the rail station in the city. As long as it's not a lag fest...

[**Mount Chungusta**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Chungusta) was a country on [CivTest](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivTest), a short-lived experimental Civ server run on [Minetest](https://civwiki.org/wiki/w:Minetest). Its name derives from the long-living state of [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta) (where many of its citizens hailed from) and the ironic meme of [Big Chungus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/w:Big_Chungus). The country was one of the most developed on the server, becoming the first nation with developed factories as well as a bunker and vault. The country had several minor conflicts involving Chungustan citizen affairs, but developed a minimal, reasonable albeit amusing "minarchist" law structure like Mount Augusta's that held throughout its iteration.

With the server turning offline in April 2020, the country's citizens became inactive for a time, but eventually moved to [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic). Many of its citizens played a major part in founding the aptly-named [Mount September](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_September).

### The Temporal Isles Conflict

I mean, it's nice that one of the nations literally has an adjective in its name so I just used it for the header? If this catches on I will be sorely disappointed.

This is provided in chronological order, so ordering on the posts may be extremely different than what it looked like on the subreddit.

- On November 23rd, Temporal Isles [provided evidence of Arnen leadership of obby griefed the Isles on November 23rd.](https://preview.redd.it/a08mfsvx042a1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=75d9bd99bc37be80e961c8cba1fa61630a6f7f2d)
  - They accused that DockerImage wanted to [pearl Blu9701](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z4fri3/the_temporal_isles_official_statement/) after Arnen leadership had ["joked" before they would obbybomb Temporal Isles](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1004329269473857556/1045786413469270116/IMG_3225.png)
- In response, Temporal Isles hired some fighters, calling themselves the Kinkou Order, who are loosely affiliated with Estalia. They arrived in Arnen, and according to Arnen leadership, attempted to breach the Arnen factory bunker.
  - They eventually retreated and were confronted by Icenian and Gang Shi fighters before retreating again to their skybunker.
    - Icenia's involvement was triggered as chosentwice, a Temporal Isles fighter, had killed Icenian leader ChrisChrispie and stole or burned his gear, so Icenian and SEC forces moved to confront them.
  - [Acuhdemiic denies these claims](https://imgur.com/A9uchmP) and asserts that his squad was confronted by all of them in Arnen at once.
- [Arnen declared war on the Temporal Isles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z45txv/a_denouncement_and_declaration_against_temporal/) after the attempted raid. [Temporal put up a post backing it up](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z4fri3/the_temporal_isles_official_statement/)
- For additional context for both sides:
  - several fighting people in Temporal have moved over from Estalia, as a result of them being involved, [they've voluntarily removed themselves from Estalia.](https://imgur.com/yHjfAvw), believing that it's the right thing to do to protect a small nation.
  - [TolypeVelleda was pearled inside Kallos territory](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/542051272501755904/1045713990602473552/Screenshot_2022-11-25_at_14.53.56.png) under Temporal hands as additional vengeance after Arnen confiscated a netherite sword of PhysicsGamer's. *Credit to the Daily Nut & Federalist Papers.*
  - When Gwua from Gang Shi went to Temporal Isles to set aside previous issues they had and to gift PhyicsGamer some Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie, PhysicsGamer attacked him instead, souring Temporal-Gang Shi relations further.
- [Arnen issued a demand to Temporal Islands](https://discord.com/channels/1038992833446690837/1038992987432157204/1045729922162888704) leader PhysicsGamer with a hefty ultimatum with them rejecting the offer.
- As a result, Gang Shi attacked the Isles, [pearling two Temporal Island citizens on Saturday,](https://i.imgur.com/rJ93pBs.png) along with [pearling DefectedHeart, a Valyrian and ally in the war.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z69ze1/the_federalist_papers_volume_i_issue_v_20_to_27)
- Gang Shi fighters then laid a siege on the Temporal Isles vault on Sunday, leaving it uncontested and disabling it along with its skybunker. As a result, Arnen eventually declared that the country was ["dissolved", continuing that the majority of their citizens were pearled.](https://discord.com/channels/1038992833446690837/1038992987432157204/1046299202591920158)
  - Despite this, the leader of Temporal Isles, PhysicsGamer was not among the three citizens that have been pearled.
- However, conflicts still continued.
  - Pavia reported that Gang Shi passed by the country's vault as some Temporal people passed by the country, seeking refuge. Estalians gave chase, leading to:
  - Mount Augusta mayor wFangw reported later that day that Temporal Isle fighters came into conflict with Gang Shi/Kallos fighters in the city and warned citizens should log out and be aware in the city.
  - Reports have also come out with Temporal Isles and Valyrian refugees also travelling the world looking for shelter.

Reactions between different countries have been mixed, but all are calling for anti-war:
- [Butternut County has so far banned any combatants](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z4q7r9/the_daily_nut_arnen_declares_war_all_of_temporal/), and [Icenia and the SEC continue to maintain neutrality in the war](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1008493067810123837/1045797903450509353/image.png).
- The Imperial Federation [declared they would do everything in their power to support those displaced by the war](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z69ze1/the_federalist_papers_volume_i_issue_v_20_to_27), but committed to stay out of the conflict.
- Icenia's part of the conflict was to prevent the country from becoming a war ground, taking a close eye of their next-door neighbor to prevent further war in the country.
- Pavia's reaction have been very hesitant, after being war-torn from the last conflict, they have raised the national threat level to "Expected".

Thanks to everyone for the information, including Gjum, BritishWanderer, wFang, Britisher/King_Cupar, Lagiacrus, ChrisChrispie, Dredd and the Elithys from the Daily Nut.

*The Commonwealth coronation, taken by reffelruz.*

### Everything Else

- The Commonwealth has crowned a new king, although not without controversy.
  - Bowilla who I've seen as a devoted citizen in the country was crowned king over the weekend, and [his coronation was intended as a celebration.](https://discord.com/channels/313388169095806986/399046963502383135/1046117145643319317)
  - That being said, theFinalGoat has had grievances with reffelruz and PergySkeel, after attacking and killing him while on the throne. His supporters believed he was the person to be coronated before being killed, and fled once he was killed. He has been pretty outspoken about this.
  - Much of the conflict has rooted from a religion difference in the country, as some texts published had prophesied the return of Peter in another form. Some were convinced the next incarnation was theFinalGoat, and clamored for his monarchy.
  - Bowilla's recount of the events says that [this was entirely meant as a sacrifice, needed to "cleanse the land" of the many cults and false prophets present in the Commonwealth at the time](https://discord.com/channels/313388169095806986/355800370137661440/1046496411866386543).
  - Bowilla eventually affirmed that this was for a reason, and was intended as a peaceful sacrifice.
  - Eventually some supporters, including OakShelf, reaffirmed their commitment to the new king. This story is still developing as the fallout is still being felt throughout the country.
- [A post on the subreddit claimed that they were wrongly pearled by NeoTide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z1f1o5/entire_playing_experience_ruined_by_simplogy/), it turns out they were attempting to raid currently claimed Exilus. [It seemed they did not learn the correct lesson.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z4s3as/important_update_for_all_simpology/)
- Dalgon was raided by TrueEnergy, a Rhode Island alt, after being unpearled by Estalia, and was initially accepted by IF but was quickly banned as a result of several rule violations.
- Flags has started a tea revolt in Moloka, [protesting high tax policy in the country without representation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z5yb59/the_great_brew_party_in_the_colonies_against_the/)
- Gensokyo has made a surprising return to Civ [following a nation advertisement](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/1046214272289607922), although it is unclear if they are seceding from Danzilona.
- [wjkroeker has stole stuff from the Estalia-Rhode Island nether colony](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z288eo/wjeekly_update_4/)
- In a hilarious funny joke, the entire server is cowering in fear after Estalia announced a build night on Saturday, although nothing of note happened. Previous build nights have resulted in the Mount Augusta voter tree being missing the following day.
- [Yoahtl is planning a PvP teamfight practice next Sunday.](https://discord.com/channels/278045721742147586/421600713898983424/1046503302445154464)
- CivMC admin [SoundTech says](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1046603935131111484), "I bought my cat some of those little plastic springs and she goes fuckin nuts for them".
- [CivReign's latest teaser is about bird watching. That's it. I'll keep the intrigue there.](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1046186113708077157)

### Multimedia Projects

- [tfw you self-insert onto a high quality graphic, fully aware you did such a thing -- and then actually getting away with it. Good job CW](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z45dcb/yodabird19s_nation_activity_chart_now_with_100/)
- [Imperial Federation also posted a really cool diagram about their rails](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1046463447459696730/1046580626280685589/Untitled_Map_1.png)
- [CivSMP has released its first episode of its playthrough.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/z5aywe/civsmp_episode_one_premieres_today_at_12et_a_civ/) It's 40 minutes, and they are trying to get the Civ point across. I personally hope it's paced faster in future episodes.

He's in the process of constructing the map himself and it's starting to come together.
