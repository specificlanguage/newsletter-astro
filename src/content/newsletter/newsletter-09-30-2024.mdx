Good morning and happy Monday from the Pacific Northwest!

With the temperatures here cooling down to around 50-60 degrees, and the clouds rolling in for most of the day, it's setting in. Yep, it's fall.

I'm so glad that so many people showed up and competed in the Olympics this time -- it's always wonderful to see. And it's interesting that we've had such a long time since a major war; although it's kind of expected for this time of year we haven't really had a major peace period like this since CivClassic. Of course, I may be just jinxing it.

Enough spection from me, let's get to the news:

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is the Olympics' closing ceremonies in Kobylinki, Yoahtl. Once again, I decided to highlight the whole community coming together for some amazing fun and games with week. I'm a little sad I wasn't able to come this weekend (*i need sleep!*) but of the few events that I attended it was so fun to have everyone around. I can't wait for the next one.

### Featured Article

</div>

*This week's featured article is a repeat of [June 1, 2023](/newsletter/highlights-06-06).*

**[Empty Promises](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Empty_Promises)** was a Civ magazine that highlighted articles, news, columns, interviews, cartoons, and other affairs related to Civ. Occasionally published by [Dr_Oracle](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Dr_Oracle) throughout the later years of [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft) and in [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic), it was frequently marketed as "Civ's longest running newspaper/magazine/bad joke". Its main selling points were its high effort to design along with its commitment to investigative journalism, generally well received by the community. It often tackled challenging subjects, such as Nether Factories drama and recovery efforts during the late years of the [Titan](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Titan_War) and [HCF](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HCF_War) wars in Civcraft, and featuring or interviewing figures like [sintralin](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Sintralin) and [bgbba](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Bgbba) during the [Somber War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Somber_War) giving both perspectives of the war's outbreak.

Empty Promises was unique as it was one of the only fully compiled, true-to-its-form, and sometimes open-sourced Civ magazines; many Civ newspapers today only focus on current events and rarely run interviews, op-eds, features, or showcases about items that had little to do with current events. Dr_Oracle has since gone inactive, although occasionally played in the [Augustan Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Augustan_Federation) in its later days.

*This week's featured image is* Empty Promises' *13th issue, highlighting Pacem.*

### Around the Server

Now that school has started, news has been relatively slower.

- The Yoahtl Olympics finished out this past weekend to a great success!
  - [Icarus ended up winning several events on the final weekend](https://i.imgur.com/tylHqz8.png) (cr: x1025), with a huge win in Hockey.
  - The [Anarchy Terrarium PvP event was mired in a small bit of controversy](https://i.imgur.com/SxM7bcg.png) as players were able to take any part of inventory of their opponents, this was quickly revised that you couldn't take any direct combat items.
  - Rivia [also sponsored the event with over 750d handed out to medalists](https://i.imgur.com/hmkWnAv.png), so if you haven't claimed your diamonds yet, it's basically free real estate
- Salerno's prime minister, [African_Warl0rd was banned](https://i.imgur.com/FcvSIqc.png), following revelations of controversial actions from several years ago prior to, and during, his time on, Civ. While he plans to appeal, he stepped down from the position and [spaceisalive was announced as the temporary Prime Minister before their next elections.](https://i.imgur.com/eAOJ3JJ.png)
- [Wergo made two posts (but I'm only posting the first here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fqzwlo/ill_help_volterra_out_post_claims_on_wergo_here/) about his pearl being held by Volterra.
  - Volterra has *not responded* to either of these posts with additionally blocking Wergo, and still no reason has been specified.
  - I did not have time to research this entire post, however [it is worth noting that people do generally agree that the metagame's move to Discord has been a disaster for the Civ community](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fqzwlo/ill_help_volterra_out_post_claims_on_wergo_here/lp9beg4/).
- Ishir_ set up two surveys about infrastructure in Karydia, [one about living preference](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fqnf8y/karydian_consensus_question_1/), and [lack of development](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fqnjgo/karydian_consensus_question_2/).
- A newfriend set up [a new country named South Ireland](https://i.imgur.com/oLkNlTp.png), but [conducted himself in such poor quality](https://i.imgur.com/BZjtwEt.png) that he was [pearled](https://i.imgur.com/BfdeM4G.png), threatened to dox, and banned in such a short time that I talked way more than this conflict is even worth
- [Gidein was elected to a second term as Archduke of the Great Western Bay](https://i.imgur.com/xb7an4d.png).
- Zatoka introduced their new newspaper, [the Zatokan Pravda](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fsayjv/the_zatokan_prawda_iii_sep_29_2024/).
- [Ghas__ announced his retirement on CivMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fo4vv6/ghas_retirement_from_civmc/). Yeah right.
- Pavia's latest Prime Minister polls sees [a surprising resurgence for UPP in the polls after a few weeks of excitement from LUL.](https://i.imgur.com/qC4E5g1.png)
- For your single metagame news point of the week: [jbblocker opened a new Civ PVP server, named Civ Arcadia](https://i.imgur.com/AK0W1QQ.png).

## The Fun Stuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/ONjYH2G.png)

*A little of a garden grove atmosphere in Zaros (cr: ToesSquared).*

### Calendar

Only one long-range event on the calendar this week:

- [FlamingSofa announced a Spooky Map Art themed competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fkzg40/mapart_competition/), due for October 30.

### Builds

I don't have a lot, but here's a few highlights from what I saw this week:

- [Seekinq has some posts of Adria/Pavia, still as beautiful as always](https://i.imgur.com/j1xWdmD.jpeg)
- [Tatsu's finished off the Highgrove bridge to Aurellia](https://i.imgur.com/PG04fIc.png) -- god I have to finish my Aurellian project....
- Halland's [new bridge over the river reminds of a particular place...](https://i.imgur.com/2XwLrsB.png) (cr: mattbruhr)
- Although you can only see a few builds here, I [love the countryside farmer vibe that's been going in Zaros.](https://i.imgur.com/ONjYH2G.png) (cr: SeldomSh0ck)
- The Sybillian church is [one of those churches that reminds me of New England covered in snow in the winter, it's perfect](https://i.imgur.com/PvHXT56.png) (cr: ToesSquared)
- It's rare that one can make Acacia planks look good, [so huge credit to Karydia Imperial for making it look great, even in a storm](https://i.imgur.com/Wm7h8vv.png) (cr: Potato_Duke)
- Exyria's [new map art stand is a great addition to their main square](https://i.imgur.com/a4SrVuV.png) (cr: butter_villager)

### Non-Civ Content

- [#runninggoals](https://i.imgur.com/EpIOWmC.png)
- [probably the most unhinged siivagunner rip i've ever seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r8LYOl0fWw)
- [I have unfortunately just discovered Pizza Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZl6Whg6m5k) and how good it is, but I have no desire to ever play it. Watching speedruns do be crazy though
- [I'm becoming very committed to getting an electric bike -- this one in fact](https://www.ternbicycles.com/en/bikes/471/quick-haul-p9). While I do love Seattle's public transit system so much (as much as I also hate it), getting to the northern/southern/eastern reaches and islands with this would be so much easier in my opinion. Plus, it's the hills (not to mention my company would be paying for most of it).

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/2XwLrsB.png)

*Halland Bridge in the Imperial Federation (cr: mattbruhr)*

Last week, we had **60 responses.** I think good (and possibly controversial) questions make people turn out.

### Word Conveyance Method

![](https://i.imgur.com/IaoFhVP.png)

I knew that most people prefer to read the newsletter on their phone, but it's relatively surprising that more people these days are reading the news on a computer. Fun fact, I didn't really optimize the site for mobile but it turned out extremely readable anyway out of the box, so it's an incredible bonus.

For those with large browser windows, how do you like the navigation bar on the right side? That's been a feature on the site forever, lol!

### Admin Perception

I'm sure you're all waiting for this one.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RK4JsYr.png)

I am suspecting there is somewhat of a vocal minority about the admins. You could bring up a whole lot of criticisms about the admins' actions:

> Slightly negative, they make dumb decisions way too quickly like banning sloth and won’t admit they were wrong.

> Broadly negative. For the period I was playing transparency and approachability were huge issues, and I think the admin’s priorities were misplaced. CivMC always felt balanced more towards powerplay than casual gameplay, and that the admins didn’t do a sufficient job of creating room for healthier playstyles.

> They're doing a lot of work but consistently do something community is against of. SoundTrch[sic] always says they do a lot and can't do more although that's not even what people ask them to do.

> They're always concerned more about the server (mechanics) than about people actually using it

> soundtech is one paint diagram off becoming crimeo 2.0

...and there's more, way more vile stuff that *we aren't going to talk about in this newsletter.*

However, there were several people that admit the admins have generally excelled in one field:

> CivMC admins suffer through a truly thankless job [...] It is easy to debatelord each individual decision they make, but at the end of the day, this is a passion project for them and they do good work! It is NOT easy to manage a commnunity AND gameplay in the way that they do, so I'd say I view them positively.

> They quite literally do it for free and they do keep the server moving, especially sneedtech

> They are committed to letting the server run and provide players an outlet to voice their opinions; even if it results in inaction.

> civ feels dynamic without changes being too drastic, and it was nice to see the recent wave of vpn shitters get banned before they could cause too much trouble.

> Positive. CivMC in general is a very well moderated space. I've been playing Civ since 1.0 and this is the most fun I have had.

> Positive because I hate server killing behavior

Most oldfriends can generally recognize that despite their shortcomings they have vastly expanded moderation efforts on Civ, and have done a relatively good job maintaining the feel of Civ meta-gameplay while also taking out bad behavior. It's something that I think CivMC might take for granted considering the past several years of incredibly barebones moderation, if any.

I should know, I'm literally in this kind of business.

## Truncated Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/PG04fIc.png)

*The newlyl completed bridge from Highgrove Castle to Aurellia in Pavia (cr: Tatsu)*.

Thanks for reading this week's newsletter. I don't have a lot of people to thank since I've just been so busy, but thanks to Wandrum, Ishir, Tatsu, natls and Drekamor for some minor support.

I think if not already obvious, people can tell I'm starting to run out of steam for the newsletter. I may take a break or two if I'm starting to feel burnt out, but with the busy life I have now it may just generally become harder to fit this time in. I rarely even check into Civ these days as my ambitions IRL are expanding quite a bit.

I do want to say I still like writing, it's kind of a zen moment in a way for me. But I'd like to be writing about other things.

I'm not sure what this means, but I'm still committed to getting replacements for the news. I know people have reached out to me about helping which I will coordinate later on, but if somehow you haven't read the past few weeks and are still interested, contact me `@specificlanguage` on Discord.

Until next time...
