Good Monday Morning from New England. Hope everyone's had a nice weekend and now it's back to the grind of waiting in the queue, again. A little quieting down this week, but it's starting to get juicy. Nobody will actually care but I took a tour around the server and many nations are building up quickly, whether its their landmark building in Pavia, expansive citygrid in Mount Augusta, large farms in Icenia or rail stations in Lambat, ambitions are running high everywhere. Let's look at this week's news:

### The Inevitable First Conflicts

#### The Western Jungle Scuffle

- The past weekend [saw raids](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v6htqy/bounty_abbyshapiro/) from Blockchainistan residents AbbyShapiro and Figasaur, which saw bounties on these citizens. Among those raided were nations on the western side of the map, including the Kingdom of ErrorL, Icarus, and Western Boundary.

#### The Fempire Incident

- As Fempire announced their claims next to Bergburg, the nation was immediately met with hostility from their leader Zelmisburg, everntually causing [large conflicts](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/226190618601324544/984746828857745418/proof.png) over [very tiny islands.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/983188933515034635/985019772104241212/unknown.png)^(**(+)**)
- Despite efforts to broker peace from Femberg, tensions reached a boiling point when Fempire "killed" Zelmisburg. This forced Bergburg and the Kingdom of ErrorL to [declare war Fempire along with the Kingdom of ErrorL.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/226190618601324544/985088016127254538/unknown.png)
- While Bergberg leaders [resolved the conflict within the hour](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/v9p9c4/impedian_assembly_conflict_resolution/), that wasn't the end because KOEL revealed to Fempire that they were hired by Bergburg to invade the country.
- The conflict continued as Zelmisburg while striking peace, intentionally left ErrorL troops out to attack Femberg, and when they  but [KOEL offered to repay any debts.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/226190618601324544/985091464407162910/unknown.png)

*Today's featured picture are team logos for [Season Two of the NDZHL.](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/d/db/Season2teamlogos.png)*

The [**New Danzilona Hockey League**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilona_Hockey_League) (**NDZHL**) was a Minecraft hockey league active on [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0). The league pioneered the spread of hockey and regular organised sports on Civ servers. The league and Minecraft hockey was created by [New Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilona) citizen RoarkLeSkif, who was head of the league from its creation until his resignation during its second season. The NDZHL was not only important in developing a distinct Danzilonan identity, but it also had positive and negative effects between is competing nations, as well as just being fun. Teams hailed from a multitude of nations, including [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(Civcraft_2.0)), [Little Latvia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Little_Latvia) and [Orion](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Orion), with creative team names for each. Although hockey continued to be played in [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0) and occasionally in [Civclassic 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic_2.0) in [Provincia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Provincia), a formal hockey league has yet to be revived since its creation.
