Good morning and... uh, it's one of the Mondays alright.

I know this week has... been one for some people, and I'm not just talking about gambling.

I can't offer any words of wisdom on that front. There isn't even a lot of news this week to talk to you back. But I hope this newsletter at least provides some distraction for you in the next 10-15 minutes, I've got a big meaty section on things have at least provided me a modicum of self-worth in the past few days.

I'm sure you definitely want to read that <EdNote>sarcasm</EdNote>. Let's get straight to it then...

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image I decided was a unique view of Shockton, Volterra. Located in the southeast of the city is a sports complex -- this picture is located near the Horse Racing area. If you've got an LOD mod like Bobby like I have here, you'll be able to see a great skyline of not only Shockton, but Volterra Prime of which you can kind of see to the right. which you can sort of see the buildings across the city. I still find it incredibly impressive of Volterra's continued building, just as quality as Pavia builds. Great work!

### Featured Article

![](https://i.imgur.com/2RCTMmP.png)

*This week's featured article was written by Wandrum.*

**[Pearled Harbor](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grasslands_Gambit#Background)** was an event in November 2023, during a conflict between [Gang Shi](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gang_Shi) and [Icenia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gang_Shi). This came after relations became heated due to several incidents involving bombing of unreinforced structures and pearling of Icenian senators. Even though many nations sought out for peace such as [Yoahtl](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yoahtl) signing a non-aggression pact with Gang Shi, they soon learned about their plans to attack Icenia, Yoahtl and other nations. On November 29, 2023, officials from Yoahtl and Icenia met with Fastestgrass, who would be able to inside Gang Shi with the help of Antea4204.

In the quick succession of 11 days, the [Dawn Guard Pact](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Dawn_Guard_Pact), Antea4204, Fastest, and Fastest’s friends prepared the day that is now known as “Pearled Harbor”, launching an attack on Gang Shi's vault on December 8, 2023. They were able to crucially damage the vault, burn the vast majority of the wealth it held and after deciding to withdraw from Black Mesa without any deaths. Pearled Harbor marked the beginning of a war called the [Grasslands Gambit](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grasslands_Gambit), lasting until December 12, 2023 ultimately ending in the dissolution of Gang Shi and their associated nations [Butternut](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Butternut) and [Lambeau](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Lambeau).


*This week's image was Black Mesa vault, flooded shortly before Pearled Harbor was posted.*

- Despite announcing that [nice dice fridays were cancelled](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gl6zeq/nice_dice_friday/) then [uncancelled soon after](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gls3qv/nice_dice_fridays/), Zalvv, Kayotic, and Ninjajack12 were announced as winners for this third week!

- City cores are such a dead concept that even when [PhysicsGamer offers to code them up for his school project literally nobody knows what it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gmbxrs/city_core_features/). Honestly, I don't really understand it either.

### Builds

![](https://i.imgur.com/WE40bqE.jpeg)

*On the shoreline in Griffin, Adria (cr: Seekinq).*

I missed running the builds section last week, so we're going to get a lot of great looking stuff this week.

- Let's start it off with something different: [TheCrazyGrape's Gemstone build which oldfriends may have a passing resemblance to a certain polygonal shape](https://i.imgur.com/8oMBfP9.png) (cr: TheCrazyGrape)
- [Novosibirsk actually gives the great, yet extremely specific vibe of a modern remote Arctic town](https://i.imgur.com/OTHEuQr.png) (cr: \_Rakija\_)
- [Eldoria is starting to form and has some great individual builds](https://i.imgur.com/iBu55JE.png) (cr: DarkFFC)
- I deliberately tried to avoid the spooky decorations in Shockton for my picture above, [but still looks awesome decorated like it](https://i.imgur.com/p0dDhbf.png) (cr: Cicero)
- [Some incredible maze-like buildings located San Rafael/Blackrock in Karydia Imperial](https://i.imgur.com/tTvgSli.png) (cr: Potato_Duke)
- On a related note, [a great southern European palace located in Blackrock](https://i.imgur.com/LUdtpAF.png) (cr: VictoriVictoric, AcronymT, Telvelis)
- [Since last time I visited Altepetl has had a green facelift](https://i.imgur.com/Ez4Z36p.jpeg) (cr: Jaydon)
- Totally [not glorifying Monument Group's flagship location on Pavia Main Street sunrise](https://i.imgur.com/rSLrNxR.png) -- but gosh darn it, it looks amazing. (cr: CedarValiant)
- Have you [actually thought to look up in Pavia's rail station](https://i.imgur.com/GVwawSv.png)? It does have that Victorian hub train station vibe (cr: \_Rakija\_)
- A little low-res but [Moloka does have some great builds that look reminiscent of its southern neighbor](https://i.imgur.com/Nhe2Pld.png) (cr: PureMaster)
- Groveheart [has actually decorated their farms and railways where it does feel natural](https://i.imgur.com/JWgda34.png) even though it's the classic food grid (cr: Gidein)
- Definitely needs some work but somehow, I actually kind of like the [cute, tiny building vibe in Soderrike](https://i.imgur.com/MwaMQMt.png) (cr: derkaiser456)
- Personally, I can't believe that [Griffin looks better and unique with every screenshot they have](https://i.imgur.com/Og66diP.jpeg) (cr: Seekinq)
- [Halland has some great city planning fundamentals down which make even the simplest buildings look very good](https://i.imgur.com/GDONHu9.png) (cr: mattbruhr)
- Some [amazing asian-style palaces in Karydia at dusk](https://i.imgur.com/phoYRgb.png). There's a lot of Karydian-Imperial things this week, glad to see it getting built up. (cr: Potato_Duke)

## Distractions

![](https://cdn.bfldr.com/UAHFH8T4/as/b4gf5pw6hbsgq9vmpkxnhgjp/RS352_VIA_Train_CANA024_sRGB_CREDIT_VIA_Rail?auto=webp&format=png&position=3)

Guess what, here's more (possibly too many?) distractions to distract you from the main distraction:

- Music selections this week:
  - A long-lost music clip [has been rediscovered after over 20 years of being unidentified,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbKTOuLCg-o) from an indie German band in the 1980s!
  - ["It was just Solstice, Tim!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_gObHt1uZA) Please listen to this for at least 10 seconds. Make sure you turn your volume a little bit down...
  - Did you know the overnight news broadcast on ABC [has an official polka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BsV8Ja0XwI) and usually get online creators to cover the song? Some of my favorites are [Anne's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8yB7T0wFQ) and [Finn's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQYz6rp5PCc).
  - While technically a Christmas song, [Scott the Woz's Why Don't You Play Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99p2lzabz0) is already a banger, [but then throw a big band and a killer sax solo in it, and you've got a masterpiece](https://youtu.be/FwCFBereJ5Q?t=1638)
  - Fall and Winter bring way to the Peanuts specials, I love the runs on [Vince Guaraldi's Thanksgiving Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aN4Cn3_AtU)
  - This [Siivagunner Omoriboy rip is like 6 levels deep on a joke so good luck understanding it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb6RuSTgl88)
  - I cannot [believe Schlahecular Manslaughter has the voice of Frank Sinatra and is making a Christmas album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hayoY2Ov8PM) (it's still not as a good voice, but to the untrained ear it isn't bad)
  - "I hope she plays Hot to Go!" "We're [literally at a Weird Al concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaiyQ7jJMaI)"
- John Green [has been doing livestreams signing his new book -- about Tuberculosis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk7hOJcID-w), which is expected if you've been paying attention to vlogbrothers
- [Andor got into my YouTube recs this week and this is a great scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaKrm5txGCQ) -- honestly not only one of the best Star Wars shows, but one of the best shows of all time in my humble opinion.
- Dropout has provided me a lot of joy recently, between [Jet Lag: The Game members appearing on Dirty Laundry](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-kAuJxLlG_A) and [Anna Garcia, Josh Ruben and Hannah Pilkes going absolutely insane on Make Some Noise](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CNqEsM26VII) to the return of [Very Important People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoFgeH1FRD8)
- I used to be a fanboy for Arc Browser for its efficiency, but I had to turn away for two main reasons:
  - [Ad block got massacred on Chromium](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270981/google-chrome-ublock-origin-phaseout-manifest-v3-ad-blocker), which this runs on.
  - They are [too interested in the AI hype to care about the core app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9yZ0JusME4), **despite the fact that they are literally called The *Browser* Company**
- So my current daily driver on my Mac is [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/), but still getting used to the feel of the shortcuts and stuff like that.
- I like watching [these random silent travel videos on my feed when I need some relaxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtkasasyA2w), this one is the Canadian cross-country train. Very nice.
- Remember that electric bike I kept teasing about for weeks on end? [I've finally got the bike! It looks absolutely fantastic, and I've been having a blast riding it.](https://i.imgur.com/IEcx0Aq.jpeg)

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/mC6rqke.png)

*A new (work-in-progress) in Estalia (cr: Tuomasz).*

Last week, we had **58 responses.**

### The Newsletter's Future

I'm doing this one first on purpose because it actually matters. I asked whether it would be OK if the newsletter were to turn into a newsmagazine, [after my rant last week](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-11-04-2024/#news-cadence). So here's the results:

![](https://i.imgur.com/zLpgYPV.png)

Well, then it's settled!! CivWiki Newsmagazine it is!!

> I said yes but I wish that you had the time to do an in depth report once a month while generally covering weekly.

I actually had this in mind while thinking about rebranding as a newsmagazine. In practice, this lets me continue the newsletter, but

- You'll still get news, but batched monthly rather than weekly. This will also just result in more complete, in-depth, and possibly better researched news stories that don't drag on for multiple editions, but in one complete story. That's also not to mention just **more news**.
- More opportunities for feature segments, such as **the return of op-eds**, more history segments, interviews, and more, in a better fleshed out fashion.
- Slightly longer and more comprehensive polls for people to look at.

Basically imagine today's newsletter but just batched altogether monthly.

In all honesty, this will give me a better balance for what I want to do personally, but still continue the newsletter in a fashion that's satisfactory to everyone. Of course, these changes will not go into effect until next year anyway, but just wanted to make a plan that feels comfortable.

### Version (Pre-Update)

This question was lifted from [another question that got a little bit of traction the previous week.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1geyu5d/what_verison_do_civmc_players_play_on/)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UV79IzI.png)

Because of the wide range of versions that CivMC supported post-launch, it's actually sort of surprising that a lot of people actually updated to the latest version, even despite the sudden announcement.

Of course, now that mods have been getting adapted for new Minecraft versions faster and faster, migrating has been much easier, but it's worth noting that adoption is usually slow, but also asked towards a noted version change.

One other question that should probably have been asked was the reason people stay on older versions -- but that's a question for the next time Civ updates.

### Map Art and Build Themes

This question was posed by **meenos**, I actually didn't acknowledge his DM but at least I'm giving him credit now!

> More Asian themed, (not Japanese, sorry nara bros.)

so, like, Chinese?

> Pre-antiquity/bronze age

> medieval could be cool

> Some sort of fantasy builds could look great. LotR, Eragon, etc.

We do already have a lot of these kinds of builds in game in places like Pavia. Or is that a little later than it should be?

> cat

Meow.

> I think recreating some irl world landmarks would be pretty cool

I think the problem with adding IRL landmarks is that you have to specifically make it fit in your world, and also replicate it well. Both are pretty hard, in my opinion, I find it easier to make something yourself than replicate things. It would be nice as a build competition sort of thing though, but I'm not expecting anything of high quality if this build was on.

> countryside

> Some landscape mart art[sic] of various cities/nations. Probably from screenshots made with shaders, those would look really neat on my wall.

> Civ Nature

> Nature

I am very surprised about the number of people asking for nature-like art or builds. There are such beautiful landscapes throughout CivMC and even though I personally don't prioritize nature screenshots (since it's not really a "constructed" build), I do think the terrain in the world is beautiful.

With that said, I think it would be awesome to make a pixel art with some sort of nature in mind. I'd love to see more nature around Civ, whether in map art or in builds, meenos has a great theme on his hands here.

> I think that an organized map art festival would be a very cool server event. There could be a couple of categorical competitions in addition to a best overall award... This would also be a great way for artists to make more diamonds. ... I hope someone steals this idea.

And steal it I will -- not. Have fun making a map art festival based around nature, meenos!

## Distraction Dance Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/FBwghtN.jpeg)

*A view of all the greenery present in Altepetl, Yoahtl (cr: Jaydon)*.

Thanks for reading this week's newsletter. Thanks to **Wandrum** for writing this week's featured article even though I asked for it like months ago, and **meenos** for giving a question suggestion last week.

If you'd like to help contribute to the newsletter, whether by writing, pictures, ads or otherwise, I'd be happy to give you something, just message me `@specificlanguage` on Discord and I'll work something out. Especially if you're thinking about doing some sort of op-ed or article-like thing, that's something I'm looking out for actively now.

Anyway, thanks for reading and until next week...
