Good morning and happy Monday from California!

Whoops, today I just happen to not be at my usual location today, visiting some family for the week. I'm still going to deliver what I can!

At least the server's died down from talking about all the meteoric iron stuff, right? Right?

Well, let's just get to the news and we'll see.

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is Icenia City, around the north side around a few nature-themed shops. I actually honestly like the more organically nature with some planning as it allows for places in the city like this, where you have great views of the skyscrapers while also having small, quiet spots like this scattered around the city. The city may not be building at the same rate as they used to, but the environment and urbanism is still here and I really love it. Looking forward to more.

### Featured Article

*This featured article is a repeat of November 20, 2023.*

**[Realistic Biomes](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Realistic_Biomes)** is a plugin commonly found on Civ servers to adjust crop growth times. Used normally to balance [experience production](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Enchanting), Realistic Biomes adjusts crop growth and breeding to be dependent on biomes, and light visibility, as well as adjust crop growth times to take hours or days for a crop to be fully harvestable. Optimal growth times usually are around three to eight hours, but are lower in less corresponding biomes, for example, potatoes grow well in winter-themed biomes, like taigas or tundras, but do not grow in hot biomes, like deserts or jungles.

Originally debuting on [Civcraft](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft), it became a mainstay of Civ servers to this day, as it slowed player progression down to prevent quick enchantments. Clay can be used to speed up growth times to up to 33%, and glowstone or lamp-like blocks can be used to simulate greenhouse environments underground. Crop growth is also persistent, meaning that it will continue to grow while chunks are unloaded. Development on the plugin continues to this day and has been used on every mainline Civ server since Civcraft.

*This week's featured article image is the fields of Lugano, Pavia.*

### Around the Server

The good thing is that being on PST means the news cutoff heads right around the server restart time...

- I'd be remiss if [I didn't put the Transgender Day of Remembrance at the top, as several players came to celebrate the event in Fempire!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gwbcnf/transgender_day_of_remembrance_tdor_in_fempire/)
- This was not mentioned previously, [but the changes that CivMC made to nerf meteoric axes finally went live](https://i.imgur.com/rDHHEXb.png), along with some other various quality of life changes surrounding [last week's update.](/newsletter/newsletter-11-18-2024)
- Not90 and MyLittleAK47 raided (or are raiding at the time of writing?) [Novoborski's skybunker.](https://i.imgur.com/BR2XLDQ.png)
  - From the limited information I have available, Rakija allegedly raided their new country, Alaska. <EdNote>While not confirmed, evidence/snitches support this claim.</EdNote>
  - The duo then allegedly found those stolen items located within Rakija's house in Salerno. <EdNote>This is interestingly also not confirmed by Salerno officials.</EdNote>
  - In response, the above duo [raided Rakija's skybunker in Novoborski.](https://i.imgur.com/Lz4nPrd.jpeg)
  - Also as promised, [the (very cute) Finn picture bribe](https://i.imgur.com/Rgejnyx.jpeg)
- Pavia's stock market.... well... had a funny incident on Sunday night.
  - SteelHand7 [decided to sell his NordCo shares](https://i.imgur.com/qPNITgn.png) in lots of 5 last night. What's shocking however, is that [one of the lots sold for 500d/share](https://i.imgur.com/zbwJc6U.png), resulting in a 2550d transaction, the [largest in stock market history](https://i.imgur.com/6sGSU31.png)!
  - Further insane transactions continued throughout the night, including [the second lot being sold at 120d/share](https://i.imgur.com/7bX06EJ.png), [a 125d share buyout of Lyrean Rail](https://i.imgur.com/DWsENRF.png), several Tusk Armory share lots bidding at 114d/share, and much more insane buyouts.
  - This eventually resulted in a conversation regarding the state of the Civ economy and [Okx had this to say after revealing that there are around 2.6M diamonds in circulation](https://i.imgur.com/duDgLtC.png)
- In related news, [Tusk Armory increased its dividends to 3d/share per month](https://i.imgur.com/k9jAKUa.png).
  - They have additionally opened back up all orders, following the insane XP spike from the [meteoric iron rush last week](/newsletter/newsletter-11-18-2024/#the-scramble).
- In more political news, [Tatsu was elected the new Prime Minister in Pavia](https://i.imgur.com/oCp5s75.png) with a coalition of left-leaning parties endorsing him.
  - They win following the [resignation of PM ArtificialDriver](https://i.imgur.com/hER91wa.png), of which [a considerable number were gambling on his demise.](https://i.imgur.com/0RuVw1M.png) <EdNote>I actually lost money on this but who cares, [let's go gambling!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpEBdU_Vlqs)</EdNote>
  - Tatsu's [eventual announced cabinet](https://i.imgur.com/oCp5s75.png) is consisted over Pavian veterans from a wide rainbow of parties; and is one of the first newfriends in a while to post in a high-ranking position.
- Several claims changes got thrown out this week. Usually I wouldn't talk about them but a lot of them actually semi-impact international politics, so here we go:
  - [Monterey was transferred to Iaumea (formerly CDM)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gy27lh/monterrey_has_been_transferred_to_iaumea_by_its/) in an agreement with MrsDoomBringer following their inactivity; Iaumea will take over the land and allow anybody to take it over.
  - [Columbia announced it would be claiming the *entire* continent that it's settled upon](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gz2hnj/columbia_claims_update/), which includes former Rhode Island claims. Although they have also granted ownership of the Erimos vault claim, [the vault holes will continue to be monitored by Estalia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gz2hnj/columbia_claims_update/lyt3xz3/)
  - Yoahtl reaffirmed that [FaunaMart's claims were also Yoahtlan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gz6xj9/update_on_yoahtlan_claims/).
  - [Arx City, a new country overclaimed Vanani in Karydia without their knowledge](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gw7kbz/claims_of_arx_city_2/). This was [resolved later that day.](https://i.imgur.com/OA6a8Rr.png)
- Pavia and Salerno participated [in a mutual build night over 24 hours](https://i.imgur.com/35uVhly.png), which included their construction of the Salernite Embassy in Pavia City, and the [Monument Bank Branch in Brunsvik](https://i.imgur.com/xK3BYi7.png).
- Salerno also announced [the creation of a Citizens' Assembly in the country](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rY5jdUN4VKFaKdRAVcaS5iVTGKgcwZhHUIi576_N5qs/edit?tab=t.0) which will give citizens direct influence on the government.
- [butter_villager was elected as the new leader of Exilus](https://i.imgur.com/2BbDJYc.png).
- [Winterbourne completed many of its rail maintenance initiatives](https://i.imgur.com/ERAtWla.png), ensuring fast rail times on all its outbound lines.
- New breweries have also popped up on Civ! Tusk Armory [opened up their Blue Moon Brewery](https://i.imgur.com/k9jAKUa.png), alongside the Imperial Federation also opening up their [Imperial Brewery Co.](https://i.imgur.com/xEfoaBZ.png).

### Metagame Highlights

- [What defines a Chaotic Evil nation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gu8uwp/nation_alignment_chart_chaotic_evil/) Are you just telling me I should just insert a bad guy here?
- [This is an essay on reparations that's reasonably well-written](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gul8ul/on_reparations/), but did you realize it was written by Coolchacha?
  - As a side note, while I don't have any evidence to back it up, reparations have been noticably less harsh compared to less iterations even despite this post advocating for standardized reps, so take this as you will.
- Artithrob, Realmichael, and [funnily enough Ez2Clutch receive wins during this past Nice Dice Friday!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1gxhql2/week_5_nice_dice_friday_winners/)

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/aUoxHVW.jpeg)

*The Cathedral overlooking St. Rafael, Karydia Imperial (cr: Urzork)*

Last week, we had **48 responses.**

### Did You Like the Update?

![](https://i.imgur.com/bM0H2wP.png)

If you aggregated the responses down to positive/negative, it's interesting to see that it's actually 27/17, in favor of positive, which for the comments that definitely would not be seen as the case.

But for now, I do think it's kind of interesting that it's, in general, a good update. However for the wider Civ economy, there's a very, very interesting divide, for good reason honestly.

> The admins should attempt more changes where they ignore people arguing about it for 7 weeks. Implementing and then hotfixing on the fly is much more enjoyable (however very controversial!)

I have heard this take a couple of times. While I do personally value player feedback, sometimes there are people who are offering devil's advocate feedback at best, and obstructive at worst. As usual, this is the part of the newsletter where I advocate for a parallel, experimental Civ server to try out changes and implement them as much as needed. Alas, being the only Civ server...

> i think it's good to have a late game wealth sink but i wish it was less PVP-centric. the ability to upgrade factories is already big, I don't know if we also needed big changes to which of the sweaties now becomes even more invincible

I agree with this point, so, so, much. While I think this was a good thing to drastically change the PvP meta, the fact it's a late game addition is such a bad thing for the Civ economy. Not to mention it's pretty much giving power to the rich.

> I have already seen some very cool emergent gameplay come from this. With mining of the ore being taxed and treaties being made to keep trading of the ingots inside an alliance... Not first getting feedback from players wasn't the best, but honestly understandable if you see what happened when it was first announced. Keeping it secret just created its own fun event like a gold rush.
As long as we get new things I don't really mind, but for next major update like expanding the world maybe do involve the community in that.

Wholly agree with this one too, although, not very surprising. I think it's still early though, we haven't seen these implications play out in a wartime setting though, which would massively change the stakes.

> [A very long response that involves them complaining about admins have been changing positions, saying that they are not becoming very receptive to feedback, despite being so much earlier this iteration: "Again, the admin team didn’t care because everyone who disagrees with them is 'biased' and therefor[sic] wrong." You probably know who you are if you wrote this.]

On the flip side of the coin, stuff like this is starting to become more reflective of the admin team as of late. While I really like them (and I'm not being paid in any way to say that), I think the fact that this update got dropped without any prior notice kind of betrayed the trust of a lot of players on the server. While I can tolerate some rudeness, since Civ players can be pretty abrasive in nature, at least some sort of hint and a little more though into balancing really overpowered tools should have at least been in order.

I was personally under the impression that this update was simply adding PvP; the fact this added a great deal to the server was, while good, incredibly contentious.

> This update hurts every kind of player. This late-game expansion hurts power players who have their work invalidated by overpowered instruments, and it hurts new players by furthering the gap between newfriends and OGs. The admins want to spark conflict; but fail to update PvP to allow newer nations to meaningfully participate in that conflict.

> I mean it's ok but I think basing it around nether portals is a tad bit elitist. It would be cool if the ore was placed randomly underground.

> I like the new ores, as well as the nerf to antiplace, but I also think this will cause further stratification between the power players and everyone else

This is kind of why I'm personally a little skeptical about this update. A GTNH-size expansion has never really been had on Civ and I'm afraid that while this adds a small spark to the economy, it's going to put the PvP game into an overdrive ending with villagers playing with sticks having nothing else to do to stand out. I think if it wasn't tied to nether portals, people would definitely be less mad.

In a nutshell, while this is a *good enough* change to gameplay, my personal position is that Civ's tech tree, economy, and country involvement needs to be more horizontal rather than vertical. Civ's gameplay has already matured so much, why do we need to add another stage above what we already have?

### Vote Nice!

I'd highly recommend you share this with your Civ friends -- I'd like to give nice, wholesome comments to everyone next week!

## Thanks! Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/LcyhnjS.png)

*A collection of Pavians and Salernites gathering together for the construction of both an Embassy in Pavia and a Bank Branch in Salerno (cr: Bronnakus).*

Thanks for once again reading this week's newsletter! Somewhat of a special thank you this time because it's the newsletter edition. I really appreciate all of you who read to come around and read this hastily written stuff every week.

~~There is nobody to really thank this week~~ Bro, I really didn't write this on Sunday night did I?? A big thanks out for Empop, Cissonius, Gamertime, SteelHand7, Not90, VilyanZ, Okx, Gobblin, Hakr_, Ishir_, Bronnakus and whoever else I missed throughout the bolt of energy that was Sunday night.

Anyway, I just want to thank everyone who's helped out on the newsletter in some capacity in this extremely long journey so far -- every small contribution has made the newsletter what it is today and you should be very proud of what any of you've done. I can't specifically pinpoint every person since there's so many, but a few I'd like to point out are:

- BritishWanderer for pulling out long nights when I have dumbass rewrites
- Cissonius for pinning the newsletter to the subreddit every week when there usually isn't a reason to
- Shadno for basically doing the same thing and then being an active promoter on the subreddit
- Xcios for continually thinking up very good and then much later unhinged poll suggestions
- RedDevel for being very supportive and participatory of any admin questions I have
- Gjum for putting funny memes in the newsletter planning chat sometimes

There are countless others that have reached their grubby (but very helpful) little arms into the newsletter but I just want to highlight these superstars for continually helping me along the way.

<ColoredBlock color="bg-green-400" darkColor="bg-green-700">
  If somehow you want to join this list, please feel free to message me to create newsletter content! I'll be looking for more as we continue to head into the new year when this becomes a monthly newsletter! Message me `@specificlanguage` on Discord.

Thanks for reading, have a restful Thanksgiving (for those who celebrate it) and until next time...
