Good morning and [happy Marathon Monday](https://i.imgur.com/GSVL4Rd.jpeg) from Boston!

I can't give that much away in Boston, and I'm not running a marathon today, god no. But it's been a very hectic and also exciting week for me in real life, so much so that things are moving surprisingly fast in my own life. There's not much that I can say right now, but in short, it's good to have tough decisions in this case.

But within Civ, I know we're in a peaceful period, but I know there's going to be something big sooner or later. Maybe we just have to wait until the summer to get something moving again...

Are we ready for the news?

I figure since today's a major sporting event day, at least in Massachusetts, I wanted to find some sports in Civ. Not the Olympics, yet though, but I decided to take a trip to Margaritaville and their hockey stadium. After a great ride on the rollercoaster and taking the sights, the islands have an incredible amount of detail, and this hockey arena fits the area perfectly, from stands and rollercoaster reminiscent of [California Adventure]. Always lovely to see them and can't wait to see what's new in a few months!

### Featured Article

**[Adina](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Adina)** was a country on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) that had a significant Spanish, Moorish and Caribbean theme that extended to their builds and government. Originally setting within [Vitelian](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Vitelia) territory in 2018, the country became independent following its collapse and developed its own government. Despite a tumultuous political history with raiders, attempted coups from countries such as [Astonia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Astonia), and monarchical struggles for power, the country continued to develop various builds by the time [ImperatorMendes](https://civwiki.org/wiki/ImperatorMendes) came to power as president. By the late stage of the map, the country was part of the [Confederation of Eastern States](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CES) and became a territory of nearby [Caledonia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Caledonia).

The country was unique in that it migrated from various settlements, from Antigua, a typical village that was Carribbean themed, to settling nearby Tobago y Corona and finally developing Adina City, which developed on a large cliff and adopted a Arab and Moorish-like architecture style and was the hotbed of Republicanism in the country. Along with major churches and seats of government there, it became a minor economic hub, with many shops and rails there making it a small hub in the sparse southeast of the map. Although there was no notable successor, it is one of the few successful instances that survived through multiple rounds of political turmoil on Civ.

### News Around the Server

- Slothinasuit was pearled (again) by The_JKH on Thursday.
  - In general, the reason was due to [Sloth appearing near a Naran bunker](https://i.imgur.com/qS2yT3g.png), with the intent of returning a bastion.
  - This was only compounded with PhysicsGamer also intending to head to this bunker as well, [although he said he was trailing behind by a significant margin.](https://i.imgur.com/l8sSnmK.png)
  - He claimed was pearled near Slothistan, so technically this could be charged as an Imperial Federation crime, however this doesn't seem likely.
- President Kaprediem announced that due to many citizens' inactivity, [he would be moving a considerable amount of power back to the role of the President](https://i.imgur.com/QEgz7gK.png), with the Metro Council and Mayor of Lambat City being dissolved.

- [Artificial Industries announced their Q1 results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6nWT0jN2CvzghBJIr8KMw7G_1ZtTzm5/view), showing a sharp reduction in revenue but hoped for growth after investing in methods that would result in expense-free methods of obtaining goods.

- [For those even remotely interested, the baseball pick'em app I'm working on has a new profile page](https://i.imgur.com/w0yCk5T.png) -- I want to push this out into testing very soon, so hopefully I can show it to you guys for real

- Uhhh, I guess [I'm saying Happy Birthday to SonicFrost because his birthday was on Friday](https://i.imgur.com/OIIakZJ.png)

## Poll of the Week

Last week, we had **54 respondents** on this poll. I think the strategy is that I *need* to make these polls shorter or else people won't pay attention as much. But is this a reflection on less people responding in general?

Our first question was about claims maps, and how much people take them seriously.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PVseAYT.png)

The statements were pretty subjective, but I considered them on a sliding scale to "most serious" to "least serious" -- the highest response, "Borders as truth", seems like the most reasonable option where people care about where things are placed, as long as it's actively in use.

While for the most part, the "borders as truth, if defended" is the consensus (and surrounding it), there are a small amount of people that don't really care or just know where things are, like the "use it as a general tool", whereas the statement for this category was actually "I don't take them seriously, but I know where claims generally are."

In the future, I would love to create a sliding scale question, but considering I'm going to end this soon, it could be different.

---

Our second question was about world wonders, and there's a much better variety of responses. In an effort to kind of spread these responses out, I'm going to do a sort of tournament-style, where I'll pitch you a few "world wonders" each week! (Not to mention it helps me with thinking of prompts on the poll!) Without further ado, then...

### Vote Now!

This second question is pretty provocative, but this could spin off some interesting followup questions.

## Journalistic Cry for Help

*Meeting Jaydon_ in Shiroyama train station!*

I've got quite a lot of things in the pipeline that I want to get done within the month, one of which is editing together old recordings of me writing a newsletter. It's intended to give a little more insight into how I write these things and the effort that goes into these (which, in comparison to what you think, isn't actually that much). No big special thanks this week, but a shoutout to Jaydon who I encountered in Shiroyama.

As always, I'm always looking for more contributors, so if you'd like to write anything that you're interested, feel free to contact me `@specificlanguage` on Discord!

Until next week...
