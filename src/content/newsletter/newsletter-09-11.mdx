Good morning and happy Monday from New England!

So uh, now that you realize today is the 11th of September, there are probably some people in comments talking, possibly even joking about a certain happening with plane hijackings. Guys. This isn't a joke, this happened in real life, and you shouldn't joke about it. People hold remembrances and [legislative tirades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uYpDC3SRpM) for this and all you can do is joke about how you and your Civ friends drove a plane into a tower. Gross.

Anyway, let's get on with the news.

## Featured

This week's featured image is the Coronation Hall in Sneg, Imperial Federation. It's one of the newest countries in the south of the country along with Regentsburgh, and after his self-proclaimed 8 months of living within the territory, along with the Imperial Federation's recent resurgence from its constitution crisis, I think it's safe to say that they're doing a great job. Besides, it looks beautiful, too!

### Featured Article

**[Impasse](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Impasse)**, officially the **Kingdom of Impasse**, was an early active nation on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic). Built from foundations from nations like [Aquila](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Aquila) on [Devoted](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Devoted) 3.0 and [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0) along with various nations in [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0), the country aimed to be a general newfriend recruiting nation focused on building. Its two main districts were built in a renaissance style along with a '80s and futuristic style. Within its first few months, Impasse made alliances with [Hjaltland](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Hjaltland) and built the [HITS](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HITS) in cooperation with the country and was a founding member of the [Western Alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Western_Alliance), but fell inactive during the [Somber War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Somber_War).

The country eventually renamed to **[Corvus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Corvus)** and converted itself to a corporation, maintaining shops in various countries such as [Gabon](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gabon) and [Icenia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Icenia). However, they began cooperating with [NATO](https://civwiki.org/wiki/NATO) sometime during 2020 and began construction of a vault hole in late 2020. aided various raiders during the [War of the Coalition](https://civwiki.org/wiki/War_of_the_Coalition), leading to their ultimate destruction during [The Fall of Corvus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_Corvus).

## The News

### Non-Civ Content

#### Sports Corner

- This week in Baseball, no hitters!
  - In baseball news this week, we move over to Japan as Orix Buffaloes ace [Yoshinobu Yamamoto throws his second no-hitter in two years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diu3OpOdsDg)  It's an extremely rare occurrence, and we could see him in America very soon.
  - Speaking of no-hitters, [Corbin Burnes was set to get a no-hitter victory...until the Yankees won in extra innings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awwpqD-XDYI)
- The NFL is back, and if Thursday night was any indication, this season will be a wild ride. The reigning super bowl champs, Kansas City, [lost at home to the lowly Detroit Lions on opening night 21-20](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/38349585/goff-lions-stun-mahomes-chiefs-home)
  - Meanwhile in College football,
  - #11 Texas @ #3 Alabama didn't disappoint, [with Texas taking down Alabama on the road 34-24](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401520183). The last time Texas beat Alabama, Ronald Reagan was president. Pundits are asking: Is Texas (finally) back?
  - #22 Colorado continued their resurgence by [beating up on Nebraska 36-14](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401520188). Now 2-0 on the season, they've already doubled their win total from last year

#### Non-Intrusive Thoughts of the Week

- In case no football news gets reported this week, [Jon Bois of Secret Base](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/movies/jon-bois-sb-nation-sports.html) has recently finished airing his latest super project, [The History of the Minnesota Vikings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GULCd-oOs1A&list=PLUXSZMIiUfFRQGbbUgQRky2-gCAFgsAiz); I find his content really accessible for anybody who doesn't even care about sports
- [oh boy, can't wait for the newest Super Mario game oh wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc6edmk0wSA)
- [I think everyone here can relate to Marcie in this latest peanuts special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjFP74OvxHc)
- Colossal Order has become 100% unhinged [and attempted to kill streamers from 50 feet above the ground -- while promoting Cities Skylines 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD-a91CYyIg&t=527s&pp=ygUGcnRnYW1l) (so I guess I'm excited)
- So one of you crazy newsletter readers met up with me IRL last weekend and had a great lunch with me -- I'm not saying who cause I don't have proof, but you know who you are...

### Poll of the Week

Oops, there was no poll last week. My bad!

Anyway, we have a very intriguing poll as suggestions from **reffelruz** and **Xcios** this week.

<ColoredBlock color="bg-sky-200" darkColor="dark:bg-sky-950">
    <Poll client:load submitURL={"/newsletter-09-11"} questions={
        [
            {
                questionID: "events",
                question: "Should there be more events on Civ?",
                options: [
                    "Yes",
                    "Hell yes",
                    "No"
                ],
                type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,
                useOther: false,
                required: false
            },
            {
                questionID: "timeline",
                question: "What time is great for events? (Feel free to convert times listed into your time zone for ease of use)",
                options: [
                    "12:00 UTC (morning US)",
                    "16:00 UTC (morning/early afternoon US)",
                    "20:00 UTC (afternoon US)",
                    "0:00 UTC (evening US)",
                    "5:00 UTC (late night US)",
                ],
                type: QuestionType.Checkboxes,
                useOther: false,
                required: false
            }
        ]
    }/>
</ColoredBlock>

Additionally, if you'd like to ask a general question for the people, I am open to poll suggestions as well.

## [Very Obvious 9/11 Joke Here] Cry for Help

![](https://i.redd.it/tzne95w6r6nb1.jpg)

*The current Civball Map of the World map. Please contribute! It looks too empty...*

Alright, I'm gonna admit it guys, I've gotten burned out from the newsletter as of late. I know it takes like maybe 2 hours to write these little crazy guys, but writing the same news is getting tiring. We'll see how much gas I have left in the tank, and I might want to move onto new things.

If you seriously think you have the will to write the newsletter in future weeks, please reach out. I'm always looking for people to work out.

If for some reason you want to contribute to this stupid cause but don't really want to write a full newsletter...

- [Write a featured article, it's literally just summarizing a wiki page that exists](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)
- Writing an op-ed or suggesting/writing features for the newsletter.

If you've got any questions for either of these, feel free to message me `@specificlanguage`.

Well, I guess thanks for reading...
