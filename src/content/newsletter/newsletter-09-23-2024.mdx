Good morning and happy Monday from ~~the Pacific Northwest!~~ oncall hell!

Because of this, this week's newsletter has been written by  several players from the community, and all I really did was organize it for you guys. It'll be great!

The plan is to have one of these once every **five weeks** -- not that I'm oncall every five weeks (only once every 10-12), but **I'm also taking the opportunity to literally take a break and relax a bit more, and give a little bit more people to shine.**

Let's get to the news.....

This week's featured image is a collection of players posing at the Opening Ceremony of Yoahtl's Olympics. I figured that it would make more sense this week to not highlight the Olympic builds for the main picture, (but of course, I have to) but it would make so much more sense to highlight the amazing community that showed up for the Olympics this time. It's things like these that make Civ so magical for people, with the wholesome community coming together for stuff like this. A huge thanks to MechanicalRift for taking this picture! I can't wait to come next weekend.

### Featured Article

![](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/7/71/Early_Varkonia.png)

*This week's **extended** featured article was written by IntentGames.*

The **[Grand Duchy of Varkonia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic)**, founded in July 2018 on [CivClassic](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic) by Mickale and a group of former citizens of [Volterra](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Volterra) and [SPQR](https://civwiki.org/wiki/SPQR) after the [Somber War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Somber_War). The state started with a little birchwood hut, which expanded into the Grand Duchy, which included many providences and notable structures, chiefly being the providences of [Nevrast](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Nevrast), [Kaiserreich](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Kaiserreich), and [Westmore](https://civwiki.org/wiki/House_of_Gobbonia), and the 125-block tall Tower of Varkanos. Mickale, the Red Duke, developed the government of Varkonia, and created the Senate, who were the main governing body. In their early days, they supported Gabon during the Alpoko-Gabon Crisis leading to Gabon emerging as a Varkonian province. This union, along with the subsequent regional alliance with the [United Northern Congress](https://civwiki.org/wiki/United_Northern_Congress_(created_2018)), helped Varkonia reach a better regional standing.

In subsequent years, Varkonia faced shifting alliances and conflicts, notably with [Columbia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Columbia) and its membership in the controversial [FRIENDS alliance](https://civwiki.org/wiki/FRIENDS), leading to defense pacts that became strained over time. During the [Infinity War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Infinity_War), Varkonia focused on advancing its defenses and expanding its vault, while maintaining a neutral position within internal and external tensions, ultimately leading to its withdrawal and the disolving of the UNC after the "Evocator Crisis".

The country then created a new alliance called the [Entente](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Entente), with the intent for powerful nations to stay neutral in most political conflict. The alliance was tested in many incidents that initially strained ties with [Corvus](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Corvus). Following an unsuccessful assault on Laconia's vault, Varkonia joined the call to arms [to defeat Ransackistan](https://civwiki.org/wiki/War_of_the_Coalition), who were funded by Corvus and [NATO](https://civwiki.org/wiki/NATO).

In 2020, Varkonia participated in a major attack on Corvus' vault, which was found to be in disrepair and to be involved in duping, leading to Corvus's banning and eventual annexation by Varkonia. Following these events, Varkonia helped defeat [Hallow](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Hallow) and the [HJE](https://civwiki.org/wiki/HJE), freeing NATO-held pearls and ending the war.

In 2021, Varkonia went on to form the Varkonian Empire with SPQR and Gondolin. By the end of the server, Varkonia [re-created the UNC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/United_Northern_Congress_(created_2021)) to support smaller nations and balance tensions in the Entente, just as CivClassic ended within the next month. Today, [much of Varkonia plays in Volterra](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Volterra) on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC).

### More SPQR Followup

You didn't think we were done with this yet, right? Following [last week's SPQR posts](https://civwiki.news/newsletter/newsletter-09-16-2024/#around-the-server), we have one final action to talk about that happened last Monday morning...

- Exyria announced that [they had pearled BattleOfSky after they turned themselves in](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1fi189q/cordoban_culture_pt_2/).
  - He did so in an effort to make things rate and reconcile himself.
  - Exyria in addition, claimed and would disable Cordoban vault and skybunker territory, additionally after more hostility against Fempire.
  - Finally, they also deemed all Cordoban players as pearl on sight if they enter the vault, although will not take action in SPQR territory.
- Once again, I will remind everyone that racism, homophobia, etc. is bad.

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/WPZrrlF.png)

*A grand view of Pavia city (cr: Gobblin)*

Last week, we had **47 responses.** Also, sorry guys, there's also no poll this week, I just ran out of time to think of questions.

### Olympic Events

This first question was about what events you're planning to compete in the Olympics.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NqBEcs9.png)

Interesting that people aren't really here for the events or are intending to compete in very light events. It's more about the community, rather than the actual events! I think this means that we need more serverwide crazy events, because I think people just like being together on Civ.

### Newsletter Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/C11fDGw.png)

I am always looking for more help, so I'm very happy that more people want to help out with the news! Now the trick is being relatively consistent for doing so...

Again, if you're willing to help with Newsletter writing, I'd really appreciate it `@specificlanguage`.

### Conflict Frequency

Finally, the last question was about whether you thought there were too many conflicts this summer.

> I would say no. Seems that the larger alliances and pacts have largely settled into being more spheres of influence and policeman against non-aligned raiders or rogue state actors. I would imagine at this stage in the world, there would need to be something truly horrific for large state v state conflict to break out again

> not enough conflict. there wasn't even a conflict that destroyed a nation. just shitters and weepee roaming around in a post gang shi world.

> The conflicts were a little lackluster. They didn't feel much like conflicts, and the only conflict that I can say is the closest to being a conflict is the Wet Bandits conflict. The rest are just... way too minor and too forgettable and often play no role in... any history.

> Yes. I want to build without having the Wet Bandits in my local ;-;

> I just joined in late May of this year, and this feels like peacetime. All of the conflicts seem like minor things that don't affect me (or anyone who stays out of them) very much.

### Straggling Answers from the Open Response

> About newsletter question: weekly chemistry corner

I don't know enough about Chemistry (or science for that matter) to really do that.

> I think editorial's would be a fun thing to write for the newsletter provided they don't get used as a soapbox to influence the server at a widescale. <EdNote>answer continues but is too long...</EdNote>

About a year ago I did encourage people to write editorials for the newsletter -- but there were very few people that actually had interest in writing something like that, and it never really got past a couple of entries. Not only do these opinion pieces get piled down because these things are **so long** (it's more appropriate in a separate page which I have to advertise), it's generally more effective to write these posts on the subreddit anyways.

I think people read the newsletter for the **news**, not for the opinion. Plus, what I think this newsletter has the benefit of being a very quick hit (for lack of a better word) -- it's relatively easy to digest and read. I know people read these on their phones more often than not.

Having opinions/editorials would not really make that goal as easy as it is now.

### Vote Now!

I'm sure these questions will *definitely* stoke debate.

<ColoredBlock color="bg-sky-200" darkColor="dark:bg-sky-950">
  <Poll client:load submitURL={"/newsletter-05-13-2024"} questions={
    [
      {

        options: [
          "On a phone",
          "On my computer",
          "Some weird, other, unconventional method"
        ],
        type: QuestionType.MultipleChoice,

## Very Short Cry for Help

*Icarus' hockey team defeating the IF's hockey team -- with an embarrassing final score.*

Thanks to **Creepi0n and IntentGames** for going the extra mile and helping me out with some critical portions of the newsletter this week (when I barely have time to write it!)

Additional thanks also have to go out to BritishWanderer, Mickale, SonicFrost, x1025, and Zolo for some other aspects of the news this week.

Anyway, back to being oncall! Until next time...
