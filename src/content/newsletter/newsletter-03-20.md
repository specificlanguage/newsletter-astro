Good morning and happy belated St. Patty's Day from New England!

I've lost my sleep schedule this week not because of the partying around me but just because it's been a stressful week and I've been playing stupid stuff that isn't called Civ lately. There's a lot going on in my life right now and somehow I still find the time to put in 4 hours a week to make this newsletter, so I guess that's pretty cool don't you think?

I still find it impressive that I'm keeping up in the Civ community despite not having played regularly since early September, so I guess it's nice to have an unbiased view of the world since then?

Alright, then let's look at the news.

This week's featured image is Gâí'ádôr's capital Vâlêmýth. If you don't recognize that name, you might more easily recognize it by West Virginia (no relation to Ohio). As many of you know on CivReign, the seasons change globally which means that a lot of the textures change and make things a little more beautiful every single change. By year two, people have started getting used to the seasonal change and the scarcity and have adapted their build styles to make something amazing like this. Great work from these guys and looking forward to more in the future!

The **[New Danzilonan Civil War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilonan_Civil_War)** was a political struggle for power in [New Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilona) on [Civcraft 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_2.0). In Danzilona's previous iteration, the country was an agrarian, socialist, and democratic nation, which followed onto their second iteration. However, when an NDZ monarchist leader, neodan99 attempted to make a town within the [Danzilonan Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilona#The_Danzilonan_Federation). This triggered a socialist counter-revolt by [Lowtuff](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Lowtuff) and Gant2000, taking control of the capital, [Melonwood](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Melonwood).

Over the next few years until the end of Civcraft 2.0, Dan made several attempts to bring the monarchy to power, including writing bills that attempted to bring multiple people to power. Following the monarchist and socialist truce during the [Riverford War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Riverford_war) and the [Aeginan independence movement](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Aeginan_independence_movement). Socialists eventually won out when Des23 introduced a bill that brought "full communism" to New Danzilona. While a short-lived second phase of the civil war occurred, New Danzilona's successor, [Nova Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Nova_Danzilona), became communist in [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0). [**Full article...**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilonan_Civil_War)

- More Olympics happenings wrapped up this past week, with
    - [Yodabird releasing coverage of the PvP event](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11q00mw/nara_olympics_geared_1v1s_compilation/) and [S4NTA releasing his POV of the PvP finals](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11quvwg/nara_olympics_geared_1v1_tournament_gold_pov/)

They [eventually made a post on Sunday afternoon](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11vuikp/theboss_shits_and_pisses_all_over_the_cringe_a/), claiming that the group, self-proclaimed Kibblestan, were conspiring against Yoahtl.

    - After an instigation by the North Africans and a short trial, the country successfully seceded from the country.

    - OakShelf has said that he sees that the move to the IF will result in a more active community and more subsequently newsworthy events to happen.

    - [The three countries also founded the Protection Pact of International Security](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11u4knf/the_federation_of_warmia_peoples_republic_of/), which might be one of the most unfortunately named pacts ever

    - They've also put [all of Gang Shi (minus the build friends) under their wanted list, restricting any of them from entering the country.](https://discord.com/channels/947234837612359701/1058060079896735894/1086321409745240075)

## CivReign News

![](https://i.imgur.com/GwSLqCH.jpg)

*The wheat farm in Laurentia at Calenardhon along a very sweeping landscape through the mountainous forest.*

- While the scarcitycraft has generally subsided with [relatively fewer updates this past week on CivReign,](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787220815487016/1084659853068341278) the current attention is on balancing the economy and general quality of life improvements.
- Speaking of the economy, [Laurentia announced early in the week that they would cap the price of tin trading to 4 copper to 1 tin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11qfi9f/tin_and_copper_market_the_grand_council_of/).
    - While it seemed reasonable to put a cap at the time, some pointed out that the price was [too competitive that they would run out of tin, as the market rate was closer to 6:1 or higher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11qfi9f/tin_and_copper_market_the_grand_council_of/jc35ddc/)
    - In the short term, [Laurentia affirmed that they didn't expect anybody to be able to match this rate at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11qfi9f/tin_and_copper_market_the_grand_council_of/jc3auqi/), and that they accounted for this policy.
    - Petoria in response [stopped all trading of copper and tin in the country until tin and copper prices stabilize](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11qnxyg/petorian_copper_exchange_decree/). We all know [autarky is the answer](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-26/new-age-autarky).
    - Later that week, Laurentia [reraised the tin-to-copper rate back up to 6:1](https://discord.com/channels/1073671116968697927/1084883025642401952/1086264452934008872), citing that there was "unverified and incorrect information" and apologized for "increasing tensions" in the region. So far as I was aware there were no tensions.
- Okx and Doom_Weaver disappeared off the server late on Saturday (Sunday?) night.
    - Generally, claims of the duo being banned cannot be verified, as [some sources say it was due to violating the "King of the Ashes" rule](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Okx_and_Doom_Weaver_Raids) that prevents users from raiding excessively to deliberately make people quit the server.
    - [However no specific evidence or concrete claim from the admins can establish this](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/908505477804064859/1086635203851726960). I also probably don't even have the time scale right for this.
    - It was eventually confirmed from Okx that he was banned due to the KoTA rule.
- A [rogue Courronite raided Aethenia and LunaaCatt in Laurentia before being pearled by King_Cupar](https://sites.google.com/view/thelaurentiandispatch/volume-one-issue-six) this past week, he is currently arrested and awaiting trial. *Crossposted from the Laurentian Dispatch.*
- Speaking of Courron, after nearly a month of server time the Duchy of Courron is still determining its flag design after crowdsourcing designs from their citizens, so hopefully they actually get to do something later!
- ThePayman [has announced the CivReign Infrastructure Alliance](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11ttobm/civreign_infrastructure_alliance_announcement/), striving to foster global cooperation on the server. In addition to their Civ Mining Counter, they're hoping to build an intercontinental rail and horse tunnel.
- With [a world map being published by KingoftheMochas on Tuesday,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11rg9jh/map_of_the_world/) several nations were eager to finally claim the lands they had, including [Mount Ida](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11rkden/claims_of_mount_ida/), [Norlund](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11rgoza/claims_of_the_kingdom_of_norlund_kingofthemochas/), [Hauthollia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11sga3c/hauthollias_claim_flag/), [The Brigantines](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11t4hvu/the_brigantines_claims/), and [the CCTT](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11t5340/eastern_claims_for_cctt/).
    - These were all [ultimately compiled by Pandastical giving us a full claims map](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivReign/comments/11uqicp/here_is_a_rough_world_map_i_made_based_on_the/) (sorry man, you're now the defacto claims map guy)

## Everything Else

### Other Civ Servers

- If there's already four Civ servers in the mix, why not another one? [Owain_X quietly announced a new project, CiVanilla on CivRev discord](https://discord.com/channels/824717853834870845/910289205698125884/1086416328350498836), with the aim to be a shorter iteration time with no prison pearl but on 1.19 in order to test those plugins out.
    - It's essentially acting as a double beta test for CivRev since the plugins for the server will eventually upgrade to 1.19 by the time CivRev leaves beta.
- I'm personally not even sure how active CivVie actually is anymore? When I attempt to query the server, there aren't many people online...

### Metagame Highlights

- See I thought I would make Vaults the featured article this week but I already featured it several months ago, [but I still asked Estalia which ones were the best vaults anyway](https://discord.com/channels/984384844236718090/984385864740265994/1086417154041184297)
- There are quite a few people doing Jackbox or Gartic Phone games from the past few weeks [from CivReign](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1086441023883976735) to [Estalia](https://discord.com/channels/984384844236718090/984385864740265994/1086443550046179428) to [Dr_Bacon_Hair](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/960952809447100416/1086760424067833966) to [Gensokyo](https://discord.com/channels/290489032633352211/290489602354184193/1086475020664049783). What the fuck is going on do people not want to play
- Gjum's website, [civmc.tk](https://civmc.tk), now has [player count tracking features for the past week for both CivMC and CivReign.](https://civmc.tk/stats) Now you can bash on how your server is better!

### Multimedia Projects

- [Once again Henderwicz pulls out this illustrated map of Nara and it looks amazing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/11quxfq/an_illustrated_map_of_nara/) He's doing a great job and I love this style!

## Succinct Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/uB9U8hS.jpg)

*A small portion of Nara's illustrated map created by Henderwicz.*

Thanks for reading newsletter number 45! Only 24 more weeks until I quit!

It's honestly really showing how many times I've been doing this, especially since that I actually proposed not one, but two articles that were already featured to be featured, so my memory is not doing very well...

Thanks to Gjum, Thraldrek, Hoover (I'm hooving!!!), and everyone else who helped with the newsletter this week!

- If you want to write your own featured article, contact me or [feel free to fill out this form](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)! I *will* DM out of the blue if you don't, you may not think your history is interesting but it definitely is.
- If you just want to rant, feel free to write an op-ed, even just a retrospective on the past. Always good to have cool content on the newsletter.
- If you'd rather just throw money at me, [donate to my ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/specificlanguage) and you get a shoutout in return all he got back was this shoutout.

I believe that's it, see you next week! And as always...
