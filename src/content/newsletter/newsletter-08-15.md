Good Monday morning from New England! Halfway through August already?

I hope everyone's having a fun time on the server, wherever you are. Even though the war...exists...I'm looking at the positives and a lot of people are starting to make some beautiful builds and grow into a good and healthy server.

I'm hoping to get around to making a new [Getting Start Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/c4tj7x/a_guide_to_getting_started_on_civclassic/) or a second version of the [Recruitment Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/ekfemv/how_did_you_hear_about_civ_3_question_survey/), or even another [Newfriend Nations Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/civclassics/comments/fsixnl/recommended_starter_nations_2020_edition/). But I think I'll do that when I'm retired. Or leave. Whatever happens first.

Thank you all so much for contributing new articles and current events last week, and this week as well, it made the entire newsletter feel a lot more alive and active throughout the server.

And once again, **thank you for reading.** Always nice to see people support the newsletter, even if it doesn't get as many upvotes as others on the subreddit. Now, onto the content:

### Featured Image

![](/old/nararender.png)

This week's featured image is an overhead render of [Nara](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Nara)'s main city, Shiroyama. It's grown significantly in the past few weeks and aims to construct a city in a Late Imperial Japanese style. While its theme is similar to nearby [Gensokyo](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gensokyo), the city's build structure is considerably different, focusing less on grand structures, and more on a suburban town, akin to Nara itself. Thanks to prawny331 for providing this image!

### Featured Article

*This week's featured article was contributed by AmandaCC.*

The [Mery](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mery) are a group of religious and political role-players and friends emerging from the second [CCCP](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CCCP) during [CivClassic 2.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivClassic), who have played on multiple iterations of Civ, including [CivRev](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivRev), [VintageCiv](https://civwiki.org/wiki/VintageCiv) and [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC). Some consider their origins to start back in [Civcraft 3.0](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Civcraft_3.0) with Pythius codifying the role play-heavy anarchistic factionalism in the nation of [Endeavor](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Endeavor).

The Mery culture began on CivRev with the codification of the First Law of the Mery Horde. They have developed a unique culture including a constructed language, called merileh, and religion, the rha'yatshola, revolving around the central sun deity, Tshola. Today, the Mery (or in their native language, Djani'weh) aims to have a presence globally, having [formed an independent settlement with the same name](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Djani'hweh) in the northeast quadrant of CivMC, but have branched out to multiple different nations including [Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Free_Danzilonan_Republic). [**(Full article...)**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mery)

### The War Comes to a Close?

Hopefully, nothing of consequence happens after I publish this week's newsletter. Another week comes, another week of me thanking the Pavia Tribune, Daily Nut, and Lambat Post for combined reporting for this section.

- To start off this week, Toontasker was [pearled by Ez2Clutch](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wmehmh/the_daily_nut_the_war_continues/), with toontasker [yelling in global chat](https://imgur.com/MshPcf9)
- On August 9th, Rhode Island fighters [pearled three Estalian fighters](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wk4ek0/clutch_swift_carson_pearled_post_claims/), Ez2Clutch, SwiftFizz, and Cqrs0n. [Adderal posted their perspective of their escapades.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wki95u/comeback_season_9v2_estalian_fold/)
- At this point, this became the fourth pearl of Estalian citizens, with toontasker and [Adderal](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wki95u/comeback_season_9v2_estalian_fold/) posting on the subreddit in celebration.

However, this turned out to be a short-lived victory:

- Part of Rhode Island [seceded as "The Enclave"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wjqj0k/announcing_the_enclave/), hoping to carry on a tradition of [Eden](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Eden) to hopefully be a peaceful nation.
    - Later that week, they would [merge with Saren_Solaris' nation, Utopia.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wmwddn/utopiaenclave_merger/)
- gthomas4 returned from being away from the game, and [announced he would take over the shadow council](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wldbqu/dad_is_home_from_getting_cigarettes/), superseding those who were a part of the war.
    - Thomas hoped to confer peace with Estalia, Titan, and Icenia, and begin a transition process to a more peaceful arrangement as it was before the war.
    - One important concession would be like Eden, they promised to pearl notable troublemakers in the country like Vanax and Adderal, however, this has not happened yet.
    - While this was supported by some countries like [Crystalis](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wldi0g/crystalis_of_the_arsenio_pact_recognizes_the/), [Cortesia del Mar](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wleq8z/cortesia_del_mar_recognizes_the_new_rhode_island/), and the [Hyperborean Confederation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wm05jn/the_hyperborean_confederation_recognizes_the/), many countries were skeptical of the new leadership, including Estalia and Titan.
- Shadno [was released later that day](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wldbqu/dad_is_home_from_getting_cigarettes/ijt5nc1/) with Rhode Island leadership committing to returning gear and lost materials from the pearling.

### Just Kidding, Here's More War Stuff

Despite this, the war continued anyway as [Estalian leadership rejected calls for peace.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wldbqu/dad_is_home_from_getting_cigarettes/ijsn3ct/) Not only that, those calls for peace only accelerated the conflict as a whole.

- On August 11, [Titan fighters helped attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wm7ajg/operation_titanfall/) Rhode Island fighters Adderal and Vanax, however, nothing came as a result.
- On August 12, an Estalian cactus farm was attacked by Rhode Island however [there were no pearls resulting in this attack.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wmehmh/the_daily_nut_the_war_continues/)
- Late on August 12, [Titan pearled T0mmyShelby0](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wn08kq/poster_for_operation_titanfall_titans_raid_on_ri/), who according to Rhode Island leadership was an individual ["in junk prot who was AFK"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wn08kq/poster_for_operation_titanfall_titans_raid_on_ri/ik2ihuo/). Even I have no idea who this is and why he was pearled except for being in Rhode Island.
- Even further, as Pavia finished their vault on August 12, Rhode Island fighters [went to the country and broke vault snitches.](https://tribune.pavia.institute/2022/august/12/pavia-under-attack-rhode-island-breaks-vault-snitches/)
    - The vault [only held a criminal wanted for extradition to the Grand Imperium](https://tribune.pavia.institute/2022/august/11/coast-guard-apprehends-international-fugitive-wanted-for-serious-crimes/), although it was enough for [Crown Prince Gobblin I to elevate](https://gov.pavia.institute/release/2022/08/national-threat-level-elevated-to-expected/) the [national threat level](https://gov.pavia.institute/government/national-threat-level/) to "expected".
- A [second fight at the 0,0 market](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wn4yv9/the_daily_nut_special_edition_fight_erupts_at_0_0/) broke out on August 13; although Daily Nut fighters fell, no Rhode Islanders or Estalians were pearled.
    - Capri put their improvements in battles against Estalia as [an improvement on their Rodeo mod,](https://imgur.com/vKWRQXX) however it is yet to be seen if it will successfully win fights and produce losses against Estalia.
- While gthomas [continues to call for peace](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wnd4nc/the_olive_branch_is_still_extended/), more nations have started to aid Estalia in the war, mainly their Elysian allies, SPQR and Jorvik. A combined bridge attempt was foiled, netting Rhode Island another pearl, with the loss of TrueEnergy to auqust.
- Pavia [was on alert again with a crude Rhode Island skybridge heading towards the vault](https://tribune.pavia.institute/2022/august/13/rhode-island-detected-scouting-prison-by-coast-guard/), although no casualties were held, there have been reports of Adderal making bomb threats towards the country as well as fellow Elysian Pact allies SPQR and Jorvik.
- August 14th saw [two skybridge attempts from the Estalia side](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/womknb/the_daily_nut_estalia_assaults_rhode_island_vault/), this time reaching Rhode Island's vault. Nearly thirty fighters were on the skybridge during the morning's attack.
    - However, Rhode Island fought back successfully. One major problem was that Estalia's first attempt had built their skybridge one block *under* the limit, which allowed Rhode Island fighters to climb on top.
    - The fight saw [major destruction to the landscape below](https://i.imgur.com/h8nuTOu.png), and the engagement lasted for most the day on August 14.
    - On the Estalia side, Bloof, MyLittleAK47, and Watermashen were pearled, as well as Phacad3 in Rhode Island. EVDan was also caught up in the fight and was pearled while in the mix.
    - Estalia retreated and Rhode Island held a large VC in CivMC's discord to celebrate the victory, however Rhode Island leadership [still made it clear that they are open to negotiations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/woi4hy/the_olive_branch_is_still_extended/)

### More Battles

- The Kingdom of ErrorL, or whatever it's called now, is now being headed by Zach, but also by ErrorL? Things are very confusing right now.
    - Zach posts this very odd post on "raiding", but [I can't even figure out what's going on in this post anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wjggy4/koz_response_to_accusations_of_raiding_schizo/)
    - [SaltyGoomba's visit sees literally nobody there](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wk2oqc/koels_royal_guards_o_o/) except a creeper
    - [Zach tries to negotiate with gthomas to make amends](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wlwle3/best_ri_negotiator/) but is stonewalled due to the fact that [Rhode Island are labeling them as "terrorists"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wlwle3/best_ri_negotiator/ijvu432/)
    - However, there [is still a rumor going around that KOEL moved to another server](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wjggy4/koz_response_to_accusations_of_raiding_schizo/ijitqox/), but ErrorL continues to post on the subreddit [asserting](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wm9fh6/i_am_claiming_this_land_for_the_dukedom_of_durham/ik0ypy1/) that they [continue to hold their current claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wmxpyj/civmc_unofficial_claims_map_7_the_final_frontier/ik2hd76/).
    - That eventually led to this post declaring Durham to be a [vassal of KOEL,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wnls4k/regarding_dukedom_of_durham/) despite its long stretch of inactivity. What's going on here?

    - The vault eventually held a [Grand Imperian criminal apprehended by the Pavian Coast Guard](https://gov.pavia.institute/release/2022/08/coast-guard-helps-grand-imperium-capture-fugitive/), wanted for murder and treason. *Crossposted from the Pavia Tribune*.

### Amazing Builds

Of the many things that were shown off both on the subreddit and discord this week...

- Pavia's train station [was completed with a grand affair](https://discord.com/channels/523673816698978313/971089862931386409/1007994437307215994), after a long and arduous digging process fraught with unions and controversy

- [A new render of Rhode Island was introduced,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wknj1x/render_of_rhode_island/) with the big addition of 🗿
- [Funkywee's Rainforest Cafe](https://discord.com/channels/912074050086502470/963450138192404491/1007153126928826389) does not necessarily look like the IRL Rainforest Cafe
- Prawny331 made a new render of Nara that you saw in the picture above, but [this is the one that inspired me to ask him for this week's feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wkwxr7/a_render_of_shiroyama_nara_in_early_august_2022/)

### Commendable Art

- As part of the Danzilonan annexation of Melia, [a new map showing Danzilonan territories was created, which looks super pretty and professionally done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wmpw1v/psa_to_mapmakers_danzilona_has_annexed_the_melian/)

### I Have Run Out of Adjectives for Metagame Stuff

- [blablagame has solved the toki pona riddle in CivReign](https://discord.com/channels/874786745600856114/874787095569391648/1006953521729507338), and wins a $20 Steam Gift Card. The message was...expected.

Thank you for reading the (unexpectedly) longest version of the newsletter, again! Honestly cannot believe there is this much news every week, even if it makes my job harder each week.

Thanks to the following people for contributing newsletter information this week:
- GetSkinny, BritishWanderer, MrJoCrafter, Falyvu, Lodish, Des23, domi, and others for contributing current events this week
- Prawny331 for making a *custom* render just for this week
- AmandaCC for writing this week's featured article
- Gjum, Lodish, and Metriximor for also proofreading

As always, we're doing a special promotion for the month of August, where you'll [obtain a CivWiki CivTCG card](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/680144077244727322/1000894399665930361/unknown.png) for each person that submits a featured article, as well as editing CivWiki. [**Submit a featured article here!**](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)

As a note, this newsletter tries to cover all Civ server information, while it's mostly based on CivMC, it's hard to find information on VintageCiv and other active Civ servers, since many are based on Discord. Should another Civ server release or bolster in activity, we'll change the newsletter to accomodate that.

Anyway, as always...
