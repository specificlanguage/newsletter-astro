Good ~~morning~~ afternoon and happy ~~Monday~~ Tuesday from New England!

Ok, yes, I'm quite late this time around and it hasn't been as referential as I did before -- but while I can't tell you the reason why I'm late, it's a very good reason why. Even though there wasn't a lot of news that needed to be put into this one, I really appreciate the help of BritishWanderer who was willing to sacrifice a couple of hours of time in VC to work on this with me.

So, with that being said, let's not waste any more time, are we ready for the news?

## Featured

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is Pacem's main square -- well, it's not like I haven't featured it quite recently, but the architecture is so good in the city that I always love visiting it every time. However, unlike previous times I've featured the country, they're definitely ramping up development with their city becoming more populated with new businesses and buildings, and I can't wait to see their country this time be as crazy as it was on [CivClassic](https://i.redd.it/mg5oanhjufk41.png).

### Featured Article

![](https://i.imgur.com/jkP0jzQ.png)

*This week's featured article was written by specificlanguage and BritishWanderer.*

The **[Fempire Union](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Fempire_Union)** is a nation spanning three iterations, going back to [Devoted](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Devoted) 2.0, focused on a democratic centralist government. The iteration on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC) sits in the snowy half of the continent of Impendia. After continued conflicts in their region throughout the first year with [Bergberg](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Bergberg), [The Generic War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Generic_War), and [Gang Shi](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gang_Shi), they founded the [BUILD](https://civwiki.org/wiki/BUILD) alliance with [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta) & the [Imperial Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Imperial_Federation).

Although themed after the Soviet Union, their philosophy is also focused on inclusive policies and unity. As a result, their builds range from a style of constructivist to Baroque, with quirky structures and a colorful palette dotted in between. They also focused on infrastructure with long ice roads and rails to connect their country to other nations, particularly during the wars. They also participate in the International Hockey League, competing as the Fempire Punks. To this day, they continue to be a bastion of friendship and inclusivity across the server.

*This week's featured article image is of Mosskow, the capital of The Fempire Union.*

### Builds

- [jasonbord is back, with a great view of Mount Augusta](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bj1dj8/mt_augusta_renders_31924/)
- [...and then I quickly convinced him to make a render of Pavia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1blenib/pavia_renders_pt1/), not once [but twice!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1blt9gp/pavia_renders_pt2/) very soon after which I know Brit is very thankful for.

### Cool Content

- This isn't a "build", but it could very well count as one, [it's CivRush's map archive viewer, which looks so good it's basically Civ Google Maps](https://archive.civrush.com/)
- Well, I guess [PvP videos count so here's The_JKH fighting ThereWalker with SlothInASuit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bjt224/ducksmoked/)
- [This poster for Tusk Armory, despite its meme title, is actually very well put together](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bkfsfs/buy_from_tusk_armory_guise11repostfixed_background/)
- PhysicsGamer shows off a [unique dynasty lineage diagram connecting many nation leaderships on the server](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bn4ome/the_dynasties_of_civmc_1/), it's a somewhat overlooked concept I kinda want to see expanded further

- I can't wait to get [totally Paddington_Beared](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bkwt26/april_1st_just_over_a_week_away_aprils_fools/) on *Monday* next week
- I think it would be funny if in the future reputation posts are just [post claims posts like Nick's](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bn4lvo/post_claims_comradenick/) and [Toaxbis'](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1bn0ide/post_claims_toaxbis/)

### Non-Civ Content

- Brit dogsat recently, and whilst on a walk through the woods, stumbled upon [Kilmahew Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmahew_Castle) - a ruined castle nestled in the woods since 1290!
- If for some reason, you like having good music put together to make utter garbage that wraps around to being good again, [spec's been listening to Musical Tangents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTDmhxJTdeA), which also probably has the best musical comedy beats I've had a kick out of in a while
- For those not into Baseball, as we approach Opening Day (and for once, [I'm rooting for the team *against* my local team on opening day](https://www.espn.com/mlb/game/_/gameId/401568473/red-sox-mariners)) -- the big story is actually [Shohei Ohtani's interpreter under fire for gambling and extortion](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/22/us/los-angeles-sports-fans-are-bewildered-by-gambling-scandal.html?unlocked_article_code=1.fk0.mvs_.v0lltZabRZc-&smid=url-share) -- which is crazy to hear in this day and age but I *swear* I'm not making a gambling app

### Poll of the Week

Last week, we only had **42 responses**, but there were about 6 people who did not submit valid responses for various reasons, mostly because they were missing some or all of their moral foundations responses.

To keep this section relatively short than what I think many of you expected, I'm only going to analyze the average of all respondents, not only for identification sake but also so I don't have a massive amount of graphs. However, for nations who want an average of the nations total, then contact me `@specificlanguage`.

Without further ado, here are the averages that you guys came up with!

![](https://i.imgur.com/iKeOY53.png)

> *Care: 75.277*

> *Fairness: 79.888*

I think we've seen a big increase in these values on Civ compared to before CivMC, especially on something like pearls where it generally hasn't been long sentences except for severe cases, of which many have already been handled by the admins. Both of these values go hand-in-hand, and it's definitely reflected in these two stats here. This is especially seen more recently with many countries willing to cooperate with each other on alliances, NAPs, what have you. Nearly everyone scored over 60 on both of these items.

> *Liberty: 62.916*

This one I think was a bit interesting -- the website marks this as having agency over their lives and balancing influence from government. With Civ having a pretty laid back system of government in general unless you're in a role-play heavy country, people are happy being a little bit more independent, and it's reflected here.

> *In-Group/Loyalty: 52.055*

> *Purity: 53.083*

> *Authority: 45.5*

These final three have similar values in terms of conforming to rules, defining "in-groups" and having a "snobby" mindset, which I'm glad that Civ has relatively shaken off in recent years. We've seen a lot more nations come to the forefront that are newer and bring a new set of cultures into the Civ landscape, so it's great to see a great variety and not exclude people too much based on their world standing. Of course, that's not always the case, but one can dream.

---

The results in general like say that this a pretty typical profile for "Left-Liberal/Social Democrats" or "Progressive Socialist" (depending on how high you think Liberty value is), which I think is a pretty good assessment fo the average Civ player's morality in real life. Yeah, that's right you crazy socialists roleplayers, [there's no way it would feasibly work in today's society](https://youtu.be/MhQ5678cJU8?t=10).

## Average Cry for Help

![](https://i.imgur.com/cxOoROO.png)

I'd like to give a massive thanks to BritishWanderer for hanging out in voice chat for three hours on Tuesday to help me finish this barely complete newsletter -- seriously, we started at 11am and three hours later, it's finally finished. He helped a lot from generating ideas for the polls as well as writing a difficult featured article this week, so massive props to him.

I also want to thank asgeir, southw3st, zeus1776, Vulcan1776 and gabrielmaenn15 for showing me around New Callisto and Withervale, Seld0mshock and YammyAwesome for showing me around Shockton, and Butter_villager and Jindosh for showing me around Exyria. Really appreciate everyone of you guys for letting me explore your city taking pictures, even if I didn't use all of them this week.

Thanks for reading, and I'll see you next week, and as always...
