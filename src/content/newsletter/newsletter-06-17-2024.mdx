Good morning and happy Monday from the Pacific Northwest!

Hope everyone's had a great week, I certainly had a great week in California, but now I'm going to be in the PNW for the foreseeable future. Newsletters might slow down a little bit due to my schedule, as well as having to settle my own personal life, but I'm sure I'll find a way.

Speaking of which, I'm glad this was a nice and quiet week for everyone -- I don't think I could handle another marathon like last week. Are we ready for something cool?

This week's featured image is a little slice of nature. Previously, this park in Shiroyama was completely barren except the main "cherry tree" you saw here. Today, this is an entire grove of cherry blossoms around the lake, and I took this beautiful picture a couple days ago while on a quick trip around Alenarith. Really great stuff and Nara did a great job taking advantage of the new mechanics, can't wait for more!

### Featured Article

![](https://static.miraheze.org/civwikiwiki/b/b6/Gang_Shi_Attacked.png)

*This week's featured article was written by Quanton_Biscuit.*

The [**Grasslands Gambit**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grasslands_Gambit), also known as the DGP-Gang Shi War was a major war on [CivMC](https://civwiki.org/wiki/CivMC) that occurred in December 2023. The war was notable for its significant impact on CivMC geopolitics, the short and decisive nature of the war, and a double insiding resulting in two major pearl holding vaults falling after just days of combat. The war began when the [Dawn Guard Pact](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Dawn_Guard_Pact), an alliance formed between [Icenia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Icenia) and [Yoahtl](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yoahtl), launched a devastating first strike against the nation of [Gang Shi](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gang_Shi) and its allies.

The DGP justified the first strike on Black Mesa, Gang Shi's primary vault, in a post titled “Pearled Harbor'', citing numerous leaks from Gang Shi’s discord that described a plan to isolate, encircle, and eventually destroy Icenia and possibly Yoahtl along with other leaks describing further, server-wide ambitions. The War exemplified several interesting tactical sequences like trapping and then baiting an iceroad and repelling a skybridge. Additionally, the war set a new status quo for effective uses of public relations and subreddit posts on Civ.

*This week's featured article image is a view of the Gang Shi's skybridge (and counter-skybridge) on Altepetl's capital.*

### Long News

- [Truidencia, the Imperial Federation, and Transylvania announced the Antarctic Treaty Entity](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dfov8v/formation_of_the_antarctic_treaty_entity/), a regional alliance focused on peace, prosperity and friendship by committing to mutual defense and cooperation.

  - The campaigning for the position went on throughout last week, with [Renew](https://i.imgur.com/gcwE69F.png), [Pavia First](https://i.imgur.com/wrJGbS8.png) and [UPP](https://i.imgur.com/4g7sISh.png) all posting their 'manifestos' on how they would shape Pavia.
  - The campaign was not without its controversy with [numerous accusations levelled against ruling-party Pavia First](https://i.imgur.com/4Kyd95A.png), with them being held to account over [crime](https://i.imgur.com/Id1SGV0.png) and [an unstocked ore exchange](https://i.imgur.com/OpRKIPd.png).
  - Despite this, frequent citizen polling indicated [an increased level of support for the Pavia First party](https://i.imgur.com/LQCikbX.png) and [impressively high favourability ratings for the interim government.](https://i.imgur.com/HeK7iSL.png)
  - Voting began on the weekend, and by Sunday it was clear that [Cissonius and the Pavia First party had been handily re-elected](https://i.imgur.com/1OTmnOe.png), with Pavia First netting over 58% of the vote.

  - Those in the know may remember this was a frequently used emoji on the CivClassic discord, to delete overly laggy cactus farms on that server.
  - This was revealed by Yoahtlan officials to be their cactus farm -- [their cactus farm near the southeast part of the GOR](https://civmc-map.github.io/#c=9046,1813,r1023) would cause lag when players rode along the railway.

  - Vinland had reports from Bebo that "seismic activity" had been appearing near a citizen's home with natural walls.

  - The post [got major backlash over their inability to properly survey the land, encroaching an established nation,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dfzjwv/free_bebo/l8mss0z/) and the fact the land would be used to build a skyfarm, *which in my opinion, is a major waste of space on Civ*
  - [A followup post assured the situation was "resolved"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dgm1ce/bebo_situation/), although *no details were given*.
- Meanwhile, [Vinland also announced they would be opening elections for their nobility, with seven candidates running.](https://i.imgur.com/irFPldI.png)
- Anisso gained land after an issue with the Iris Confederation.
  - I have absolutely *zero proof* that a nation called the "Iris Confederation" ever existed, [but supposedly they overclaimed much of southwest Alenarith, including Anisso.](https://i.imgur.com/Hxe6Jsk.png) Not sure how accurate this is though.
  - The ATS, an alliance with various small nations across the server (not to be confused with ATE), took ownership of the territory. Along with cooperation from the Temporal Empire, [Anisso regained most of its land, along with a small portion for the Iris Confederation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dhp3d8/anissite_claims_as_per_the_treaties_of_aika/)

### Short News

## The Fun Stuff

### Builds

- We don't have a lot of builds this week because I got busy, but I want to highlight [the work that Potato_Duke is doing with San Rafael](https://i.imgur.com/0QjjWaY.png), [Delos' Market Square coming soon to live](https://i.imgur.com/zY5s6D8.jpeg), and [Icenia's renovation of their Statue of Liberty Island](https://i.imgur.com/Gpz7bB1.png).

This is then therefore a call to build more this summer!!!

### Cool Content

- Sadchamp created a great infographic on how to mine debris -- we've already included it above [but here's a direct link!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dg7t7t/sadchamps_infographic_on_how_to_be_a_better/)
- VilyanZ is not happy about all of the new alliances [because he had to make this (albeit amazingly formatted graphic!) twice](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dg4huu/alliance_chart_version_2_june_2024/)
- Although, I don't think it's updated unlike [this map of the Lyrean Commonwealth from Seekinq](https://i.imgur.com/XPPauI7.png)
- [Lusitania and Anisso teamed up for a good 'ol drink in this great Civball picture](https://i.imgur.com/lzD4jfI.png) from banyough

### Memes

- [bro i'm confused, is this the alliance graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dfuzxw/this_ones_for_you_chrischrispy/)
- [Are we really trading Amicitia sun for Winterbourne freeze?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dg3c1h/dont_sleep_on_the_amicitia_sideplot/)
- [Damn they really want jjon to return](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/1dg8lbw/pov_amicitia_if_jjon_returns/)

### Non-Civ Content

- [Your Seattle Mariners somehow have a .581 record, sweeped the Texas Rangers and are **first place in the AL West by 8.5 games**](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1dhjks8/seattles_85game_lead_in_the_al_west_marks_its/), a first since 2001. They also somehow have the best lead on a division this year? You bet as hell I'm going to be yelling about them in the next few weeks.

## Poll of the Week

![](https://i.imgur.com/fvboW6c.jpeg)

*A look down the forest in Danzilona, along with a bridge and a couple buildings in the distance (cr: peakman2)*

Last week, we had 47 responses, a little less than usual.

### Pronouns

The first question was about what pronouns do people use or identify as.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6HTAquR.png)

I did this as a "celebration" of sorts for Pride Month, but as a side effect, it does show a very obvious correlation for those who play Civ, which many have known for a while and that it's a very male dominated game. That being said, the diversity of those who do not identify with masculine pronouns are quite diverse, with feminine and gender-neutral having some good representation!

### 1.20 Feedback

The open response question was about feedback from the 1.20 update. Unfortunately, this question wasn't a plant by RedDevel, nor did I accuse him of planting this question (although, he is officially unofficially on the newsletter staff).

Although I won't show all positive responses, **I will say that a majority of the responses had positive feedback to give**, which is great to see!

> bring back my [...] fossils

This continues to be an issue with compatibility between versions. Probably some NBT issues that went rogue with the update. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.

> reconfiguring a new instance is torture. worth it for the new build blocks tho

> It has been fine but no snitchmod is tough and I accidentally let a bunch cull because it wasn't on my mind.

> Haven't updated yet due to mods.

I actually got a lot of responses which talked about the pain of upgrading their versions, especially when [they haven't upgraded their mods using this guide](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mods). Civ mods especially are slow to update so it's quite a cumbersome process. Can't wait for the 1.21 upgrade!

> I like it that netherite upgrade templates were added but i would like to see a use for pitcher pods. I would also want armor trims to be added.

> I wish it was easier to get camels

> FASTER CAMELS

Yeah, there's a few comments that are just looking for better upgrades for the current versions. I agree, though. Vanilla features are quite sparing in the current Civ environment.

### Vote Now!

We've got a repeat question that I did a year ago, because now I'm curious...
