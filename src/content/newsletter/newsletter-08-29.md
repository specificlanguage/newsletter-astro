Happy Monday morning from New England!

Not too many things to talk about besides the big story<sup>TM</sup> this week but personally I had to deal with a significant amount of drama this week which is not desirable by anyone here. Tensions are somehow running extremely high this week and I don't want it to last forever because the community's way of worldbuilding and the conflicts surrounding it are what Civ is really about, not the endless namecalling, harassment, and insertion of real-life issues into in-game politics.

Ok, enough doom and gloom for the intro, here's the news:

### Featured Image

This week's featured image is of the Free Danzilonan Republic, with both apsects of their town pictured in the render. On the left is the old town, hosting the town hall, defense ministry and the hockey stadium (go NDZHL!) and on the right is the DanzShaft, featuring a large moat diving to bedrock; while still in development, it's reminiscent of a proto-version of [Victoria](https://civwiki.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth_(CivClassic_2.0)#Westminster) in the Commonwealth and [New Yoahtl City](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yoahtl) in CivClassic.

### Featured Article

*This week's featured article was written by Des23.*

The **[international relations](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grundeswald%E2%80%93New_Danzilona_relations) between the Kingdom of [Grundeswald](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grundeswald) and [New Danzilona](https://civwiki.org/wiki/New_Danzilona) (NDZ)** were geographically connected yet hostile between the two nations. Relations also included their respective multinational organizations, the [Holy Krautchan Empire](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Holy_Krautchan_Empire) and the [Danzilonan Federation](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Danzilonan_Federation), respectively. The two countries were close geographically and shared a border with each other's allies. Still, the two countries were not a part of any mutual organizations and were largely hostile to each other mostly on ideological grounds. As NDZ was a socially progressive liberal democracy and Grundeswald a far-right chauvinist empire, their citizenries frequently conflicted with one another

Although the two countries were initially friendly towards each other, tensions mounted from a series of griefings and pearlings throughout the summer of 2014 until finally culminating in the [Yurtstead War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Yurtstead_War), sometimes known as the [Riverford War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Riverford_War), which was a direct military confrontation over their land claims involving other nations such as [Istanbul](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Istanbul) and [Gensokyo](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Gensokyo) over large border disagreements. No direct conflict occurred afterward, but their cold war ensued until the end of the server. [**(Full article...)**](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Grundeswald%E2%80%93New_Danzilona_relations)

### Somewhat Notable News

This is also known as "news that I kinda have to report on but really don't want to".

- Tensions between Gensokyo and Nara came to a head this past week, [after a skirmish between Saren_Solaris and two Gensokyojin fighters](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wv5jzh/two_gensokyo_menace_jumps_me_at_their_border_and/), Ferro and Asu, resulted in the latter two being pearled.
    - [This is a great summary of the ACTUAL play-by-play events but I'm not focusing on these specifics, thanks RektTangle](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wz7wa9/saren_vs_gensokyo_a_thorough_investigation/)
    - Two main points of the conflict was that
        - [fighting occurred *after* Saren had left Gensokyojin territory](https://i.imgur.com/L4fC8BN.png), and
        - these pearls [were originally held in a Utopian (now Enclave/Butternut) spike](https://i.imgur.com/plMdmuD.png), miles away from both countries and near USA.
    - For some legal background, Gensokyo issued orders to PvP Saren after he disobeyed their orders to bar entry to the country while the [Estalia-Rhode Island War](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Estalia-Rhode_Island_War) was breaking out. When Saren chose to `/ignore` all responses, [the issue was ordered.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyea10/interim_statement_on_dnagensokyo_relations/ilw8gp6/)
    - Saren was supposedly investigating the presence of a bunker owned by Vah, however, no particular evidence of one existing in the area has been confirmed.
- The aftermath of this situation reverberated throughout Alenarith:
    - The two countries both have had issues throughout the past two months, with [Nara accusing Genskokyo of blatant harassment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyqb6n/sussiest_dm_ive_gotten_in_civ_to_date/) and [vice](https://imgur.com/a/ANYZtLa) [versa.](https://imgur.com/a/AR6rko8)
    - As a result, Mount Augusta and Gensokyo [have both left the "Alenarith Forum" discord out of a protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyea10/interim_statement_on_dnagensokyo_relations/), a discord dedicated to diplomacy and goodwill understanding on the continent.
    - The Dalgon-Nara alliance [released an initial statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyea10/interim_statement_on_dnagensokyo_relations/) on the conflict showing how Gensokyo has refused to negotiate, and [Gensokyo released an evidential statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyni7i/a_response_to_nara_evidence_included/) soon after (which I think would have made better had it been a less frantic response).
    - In the aftermath, Gensokyo announced they would be taking a hiatus and [their territory would become part of Danzilona](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wzgstn/gensokyo_is_now_a_protectorate_of_the_free/); meanwhile many players involved would also be involved in harassment cases and were subsequently banned.

I *would* give more details on the personal conflicts here, but that starts to reach into opinion, reasoning behind offenses, and slander against the admins. So in other news...

- Titan posted early this week that the source behind much of the USA's materials during [the war](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Estalia-Rhode_Island_War) was [provided by Blockchainistan](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wx3fgr/ud_blockchainistan_operation_a_recap_of_events/), which was the rationale for them to fight over the last several weeks.
    - Blockchainistan has denied these claims, responding that [they are "peaceful builders"](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wx5nvj/builders_attacked_and_obby_bombed_by_titan/) on the server. For context, this was the reason for the [Jewish Quarter](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Jewish_Quarter)'s eviction in [Mount Augusta](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Mount_Augusta_(CivClassic_2.0)) and [Icenia](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Icenia_(CivClassic_2.0)).
    - [Eventually, a Blockchainistan-supported USA operation broke a portion of  Titan's bunker](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wy56v9/titan_takes_huge_l_against_buildfriends/), including Danirague, Adderal and Vanax among others.

### Meanwhile...

- The global war involving the USA that is still pending a name has had some relatively minor updates outside of Titan's involvement above:
    - The Red Cross from Commonwealth [completes a large humanitarian mission to Pavia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wv4qze/the_red_cross_has_successfully_completed_another/)
    - Icenia announced the pearling of TheKingCacti, a USA player present in the Icenia attacks from last week.
    - NovaCaesar [has been pearled in Danzilona](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/x09911/novaceasar_pearled_by_twigbranch/) by Rhode Islander TwigBranch; pearling a random citizen in a country not involved in the war at all.
- Tricon announced the winning entry for its headquarters to be [Commonwealth, with its large eco-friendly design](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wxvxyy/tricon_moving_headquarters_to_commonwealth_winner/)
- Upon Zelmisburg's return after -- *checks clock* -- two months, [Western Boundary has released a bounty which people will definitely take seriously](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wygtdr/i_want_that_rat_annihilated_175d_bounty_on/)
- [Enclave has merged with Butternut](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wwr0oo/announcing_enclaved_being_merged_into_butternut/), unsurprisingly bringing all of the non-New Jersey USA splinters into one state
- In a shocking turn of events, [BritishWanderer III was unanimously elected as the new Crown Prince of Pavia](https://tribune.pavia.institute/2022/august/27/britishwanderer-elected-as-new-crown-prince/) after [Gobblin I died after "tripping on his own beard"](https://tribune.pavia.institute/2022/august/27/gobblin-the-third-crown-prince-has-died/). *Crossposted from the Pavia Tribune*.
- [ErrorL has seemingly "relinquished" KOEL](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wwyp5k/i_am_no_longer_koel_i_am_now_errorl/)
- Icenia's third round of elections for Septemberâ€™s senate has started, with no major changes to Senate structure, but many returning senators are running for re-election.
- As some of [Danzilona leadership is leaving, new elections are starting for September,](https://discord.com/channels/952401079339995166/952591282386124820/1012091865962651798) a first for the country.
- Petrichor has [announced two new embassies](https://discord.com/channels/463884508308045834/921926087284518922/1011751345113550868) in the Icenian territory, Mount Augusta, and nearby Pacem.
- Many have started to [show fatigue from the current war,](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wycyh6/this_war_must_end/) but have also accepted that this is the current way of life and Rhode Island is refusing to let up, with Citylion offering to moderate negotiations.
- [Development of CivRev's 3rd iteration has started to begin in earnest](https://discord.com/channels/824717853834870845/910683593179811930/1012777754795720794), with the sneak peeks of the map being introduced as well as preliminary development on Seasons and expansive tech trees. Owain is hoping to open moderation applications in the near future.

## The Fun Stuff

*This section's header picture is of Tricon's soon-to-be headquarters created by the Commonwealth.*

Will this section actually be bigger than the current news? It looks to be a no, unfortunately.

### Exciting Looking Things

- **Tybug [released a new discord bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wycygh/snitchvis_release_a_discord_bot_to_visualize/) allowing you to visualize snitch hits on your own groups on a discord map, honestly amazing**

### Metagame Highlights

- [ComradeNick highlighted some ideas for the future of Civ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wv86ei/proposals_for_the_redemption_of_the_civ_genre/) I don't agree with all of them but it's at least a nice thought experiment.

- Low key, I really want to talk about [this post by someone who hasn't played the server for a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wyhzu9/random_thoughts_of_some_one_who_has_mostly_quit/) because most balancing has been focused towards large players, there needs to be at least some decent playstyle dedicated towards them!

This is no joke but I've seen *a lot* of arguments this week, so for the sake of everyone, [SirBoss is right](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/wypx23/a_reminder/) and if Civ is affecting your mental state I would highly recommend a break.

## Hopeful Cry for Help

![](https://i.redd.it/pp8iv910lbj91.png)

*This section's featured picture is a section of a Coalition propaganda poster, highlighting the seven nations currently involved in the [Estalia-Rhode Island War.](https://civwiki.org/wiki/Estalia-Rhode_Island_War)*

Thank you for reading this week's newsletter! Again, appreciate the support this newsletter has gotten over this past week.

Once again, I'm asking for new **featured article submissions** as I'm quite literally out of articles in reserve. If you want to see *your* article on this newsletter as well as on the front page of CivWiki, **[please submit this form right here](https://forms.gle/SZbWZQRDBxhPUNQF9)**. This is also the **final week** to submit articles to obtain a [special-edition CivTCG card](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/680144077244727322/1000894399665930361/unknown.png), which will be handed out next month.

Midway through next week, I'll also be posting the Recruitment Survey to lay the groundwork on how people like you are finding Civ (and most likely, reading this newsletter). It's a short survey but I do want to hear your own story on how you've gotten involved in the Civ community.

Special thanks to Des23 who has provided news, current events, and both this week's featured article *and* picture, she's done a lot to help for this week's edition. Also thanks to Gjum and Tybug for proofreading this week.

And as always...
