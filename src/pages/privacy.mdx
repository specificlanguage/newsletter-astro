  ### TL;DR

  The privacy policy is only published to apply to Newsletters Polls; no other aspect of the newsletter requests any user input. Polls are inherently opt-in.
  By submitting this poll, you agree for the newsletter to collect your responses, and that they may be used for publication within one month of submission. The writers are the only ones who view your data individually and in aggregate. **All data is anonymized and are not associated with any in-game account**.

  In a general sense, we follow [New York Times terms of service on comments](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-Service#3) and [their privacy policy](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/10940941449492-The-New-York-Times-Company-Privacy-Policy#for-user-generated-content), with the minor modifications of not asking you for identiyfing info.

  ### Storage of Data

In the event of an unauthorized data access, users will be notified through the newsletter and a discord announcement.

  Examples of data collected only include poll responses, which are anonymized.

  ### Usage of Data
