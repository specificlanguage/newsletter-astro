  ## Adtacular Summer!

  With the rising number of businesses on Civ, I'm opening up advertising space in the newsletter once again for the rest of the summer (or really, until the newsletter ends!) There are generally no restrictions on the ads themselves, with the only exception being **that all ads must be directly related to Civ.** Any ads for non-Civ purposes will be automatically rejected. (I also will not accept IRL money for these ads.)

  All ads are a flat rate of 20d.

  <ColoredBlock color="bg-red-200" darkColor="dark:bg-red-950">

    *Payments can be sent to MB Sort Code **HS-7362**, or you can send dropchest coordinates to me!*

    * **Text based ad**: 20d/run (see example below)
    * *Text must have 250 characters or less*
    * You should the background color you'd like (except Black or White)
    * Links allowed, but no pictures

    <ColoredBlock color="bg-yellow-200 text-black" darkColor="dark:bg-yellow:950 text-black" style="flex flex-col py-2 space-y-1 text-black">
      <span className="py-2 text-black text-2xl">A message from the UNC</span>
      <span className="text-black">In case anyone is confused, there is a tradition of having BritishWanderer make these posts, since he has the best individual relations with the community. It was likely written by somebody who would have been shat all over had they been the one to actually make the post, and I doubt BritishWanderer even read it before he copypasted it here on their behalf.</span>

    * **Full image ad**: 20d/run (see example below)
    * Image size should have height less than width, but not square-like dimensions.

  To run an ad:
  - Pay at **Sort Code HS-7362** or **DM me dropchest coords to @specificlanguage on discord**.
  - Send me a message containing your ad, either as a link to an image or the ad read itself.
  - All charges will be due at *[Sunday, 9pm Eastern time](https://time.is/compare/0900PM_05_May_2024_in_New_York)* for the following Monday (e.g. for next week, May 6, all ads are due on May 5, at Sunday, 9pm Eastern). Please note, *this is different than the news cutoff time ([Monday, 12am Eastern](https://time.is/compare/1200AM_06_May_2024_in_New_York))!*
  - Please check your time zone for proper timings.
  - If your ad is rejected for any reason, for either Civ-unrelatedness or [violation of content policies](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/wiki/index), you will be refunded 50% of your charge. *This is non-negotiable*.

    **May 13 addition:**

    For some weeks, ad spots may fill up before publishing. In this case, you'll be placed on a waitlist if an ad spot backs out for any reason for the week in question.

    Otherwise, your ad will be moved to the next week *and will be a guaranteed slot*.

    If you're flexible on when the ad is run, I can allow you to pay 2d less, and you'll automatically be placed on the waitlist.

  For any questions, please send them to `@specificlanguage` on Discord!
